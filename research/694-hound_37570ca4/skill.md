## Overview

Hound is a language-agnostic AI auditor that autonomously builds and refines adaptive knowledge graphs for deep, iterative code reasoning in security audits. It introduces a relation-first graph engine that enables system-level reasoning across interrelated components in complex codebases.

**Core Value Proposition**: Transform manual security auditing into autonomous AI-driven analysis using flexible knowledge graphs, belief systems, and hypothesis-driven investigation.

## Problem Addressed

| Problem                                                      | How Hound Solves It                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Manual security audits are time-consuming and error-prone    | Autonomous agents build knowledge graphs and investigate vulnerabilities systematically    |
| LLM context windows cannot hold entire codebases             | Relation-first graphs enable precise retrieval of relevant code snippets across components |
| AI analyzers lack persistent reasoning across investigations | Belief system maintains long-lived vulnerability hypotheses with confidence scores         |
| Single-pass analysis misses cross-component vulnerabilities  | Multi-aspect graphs (value flows, auth roles, call graphs) enable system-level reasoning   |
| AI findings lack verification                                | QA finalizer confirms or rejects hypotheses using reasoning models                         |

## Key Features

### 1. Graph-Driven Analysis

- **Flexible Agent-Designed Graphs**: Model any aspect of a system (architecture, access control, value flows, math)
- **Relational Graph Views**: High-level graphs support cross-aspect reasoning
- **Code Snippet Anchoring**: Precise retrieval of code backing each subsystem investigated
- **System Architecture Graph**: Automatic baseline graph generation

### 2. Belief and Hypothesis System

- **Persistent Hypotheses**: Long-lived vulnerability findings with confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
- **Evidence Accumulation**: Confidence updated as evidence accrues across sessions
- **Status Lifecycle**: `proposed` -> `investigating` -> `confirmed`/`rejected`
- **Severity Classification**: Critical, high, medium, low
- **Type Classification**: Reentrancy, access control, logic error, etc.

### 3. Dynamic Model Switching

- **Scout Models**: Lightweight models (GPT-4o-mini) handle exploration
- **Strategist Models**: Heavyweight models (GPT-5, Claude Opus) provide deep reasoning
- **Cost Efficiency**: Expert workflows mirrored while keeping costs efficient
- **Multi-Provider Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini (Vertex AI)

### 4. Strategic Audit Planning

- **Coverage vs Intuition Balance**: Broad code coverage with focused investigation
- **Sweep Mode**: Systematic component analysis for initial discovery
- **Intuition Mode**: Deep, targeted exploration for high-impact vulnerabilities
- **Per-Session Planning**: PlanStore with statuses (planned, in_progress, done, dropped, superseded)

### 5. Interactive Steering (Chatbot UI)

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live activity, plan, and findings
- **Manual Steering**: Guide investigations via web interface
- **Session Management**: Attach/detach from running audits
- **Manual Hypothesis Control**: Confirm/reject findings manually

### Senior/Junior Pattern

The audit uses a two-tier agent architecture:

1. **Junior (Scout)**: Lightweight models for exploration and coverage
2. **Senior (Strategist)**: Heavyweight reasoning models for planning and deep analysis

### Graph Types

Hound supports multiple analyst-defined graph types:

- **SystemArchitecture**: Baseline component relationships
- **CallGraph**: Function call relationships across modules
- **ValueFlows**: Monetary and value transfer paths
- **AuthRoles**: Authentication and authorization relationships
- **ProtocolInvariants**: System-wide invariant tracking

---

## Audit Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Setup

```bash
# Create project from local code
./hound.py project create myaudit /path/to/code

# List projects
./hound.py project ls
```

### Phase 2: Build Knowledge Graphs

```bash
# Auto-generate graphs (recommended)
./hound.py graph build myaudit --auto \
  --files "src/A.sol,src/B.sol,src/utils/Lib.sol"

# Or manual graph creation
./hound.py graph custom myaudit \
  "Call graph focusing on function call relationships" \
  --iterations 2 --files "..."
```

### Phase 3: Run Audit

```bash
# Sweep: Systematic component analysis
./hound.py agent audit myaudit --mode sweep

# Intuition: Deep targeted exploration
./hound.py agent audit myaudit --mode intuition --time-limit 300

# With telemetry for interactive steering
./hound.py agent audit myaudit --mode intuition --telemetry
```

### Phase 4: Finalize and Report

```bash
# QA review with reasoning model
./hound.py finalize myaudit

# Generate professional HTML report
./hound.py report myaudit
```

## Benchmark Results (from Paper)

On a five-project subset of ScaBench:

| Metric       | Hound            | Baseline LLM |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Micro Recall | 31.2%            | 8.3%         |
| F1 Score     | 14.2%            | 9.8%         |
| Precision    | Modest trade-off | Higher       |

**Key Insight**: Gains attributed to flexible relation-first graphs extending model understanding beyond call/dataflow to abstract aspects, plus the hypothesis-centric loop.
