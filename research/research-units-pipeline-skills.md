# research-units-pipeline-skills

> **In one sentence**: Make pipelines that can "guide humans / guide models" through research—not a bunch of scripts, but a set of **semantic skills**, where each skill knows "what to do, how to do it, when it's done, and what NOT to do."

---

## Todo
1. Add multi-CLI collaboration and multi-agent design (plug APIs into the right stages to replace or share the load of Codex execution).
2. Keep polishing writing skills to raise both the floor and ceiling of writing quality.
3. Complete the remaining pipelines; add more examples under `example/`.
4. Remove redundant intermediate content in pipelines, following Occam's razor: do not add entities unless necessary.

## Core Design: Skills-First + Decomposed Pipeline + Evidence-First

**The traditional problem**: Research pipelines are either black-box scripts (hard to debug) or loose documentation (requires human judgment at runtime).

**Our solution**:

1. **Semantic Skills**: Each skill is not a function, but a **guided execution unit**—
   - `inputs / outputs`: explicit dependencies and artifacts
   - `acceptance`: completion criteria (e.g., "each subsection maps to >=8 papers")
   - `notes`: how to do it, edge cases, common mistakes
   - `guardrail`: what NOT to do (e.g., **NO PROSE** in C2-C4)

2. **Decomposed Pipeline**: 6 checkpoints (C0→C5), ~40+ atomic units (varies by pipeline; LaTeX adds a few), dependencies explicit in `UNITS.csv`
3. **Evidence-First**: C2-C4 enforce building evidence substrate first (taxonomy → mapping → evidence packs), C5 writes prose

**Design Goals**:
- **Reusable**: Same skill (e.g., `subsection-writer`) works across pipelines—no rewriting logic
- **Guided**: Newcomers/models follow `acceptance` + `notes`—no guessing "how much is enough"
- **Constrained**: `guardrail` prevents executors (especially models) from going off-rails (e.g., writing prose in C3)
- **Locatable**: Failures point to specific skill + artifact—fix and resume from failure point

---

**Why this design?**

| Property | Traditional | This Design |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Visible** | Black-box scripts | Each unit produces intermediate files (`papers/`, `outline/`, `citations/`, `sections/`) |
| **Auditable** | Scattered logs | `UNITS.csv` records execution history + acceptance criteria; `DECISIONS.md` records human checkpoints |
| **Self-healing** | Failure = full restart | Quality gate FAIL → report tells you what to fix → resume from failed unit |
| **Reusable** | Rewrite per project | Skills are modular, reusable across pipelines (e.g., `taxonomy-builder`, `evidence-binder`) |
| **Guided** | Human judgment | Each skill has `acceptance` + `notes`—executor knows "what done looks like" |

## Codex Reference Config

```toml

[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = true

[features]
unified_exec = true
shell_snapshot = true
steer = true
```

## One-line Activation (recommended: run pipelines in chat)

Start Codex:

> codex --sandbox workspace-write --ask-for-approval never

Send this to Codex (or Claude Code):

> Write me an agent LaTeX survey

This triggers the repo skills to auto-route and execute the pipeline (artifacts written per the `UNITS.csv` contract).

Optional:
- Specify pipeline file: `pipelines/arxiv-survey-latex.pipeline.md` (or `research-units-pipeline-skills/pipelines/arxiv-survey-latex.pipeline.md`)
- No auto-approval at C2: remove "auto-approve C2" from your prompt

More explicit (less routing errors):

> Use `pipelines/arxiv-survey-latex.pipeline.md` to write me an agent LaTeX survey (strict quality gates; auto-approve C2)

## What You Get (Layered Artifacts + Self-Healing Entry Points)

**Execution Layer**:
- `UNITS.csv`: ~40+ atomic units as execution contract (dependencies → inputs → outputs → acceptance)
- `DECISIONS.md`: Human checkpoints (**C2 requires outline approval** before prose)

**Artifact Layer** (by checkpoint):
```
C1: papers/papers_raw.jsonl → papers/core_set.csv                         # Retrieval + dedupe
C2: outline/taxonomy.yml → outline/outline.yml → outline/mapping.tsv      # Structure (NO PROSE)
C3: papers/paper_notes.jsonl → outline/subsection_briefs.jsonl            # Evidence substrate (NO PROSE)
C4: citations/ref.bib → outline/evidence_drafts.jsonl                     # Citations + evidence packs (NO PROSE)
C5: sections/*.md → output/DRAFT.md → latex/main.pdf                      # Writing + compile
```

**Quality Gates + Self-Healing Entry Points**:
- `output/QUALITY_GATE.md`: tells you which artifact to fix
- Writing self-loop (fix failing subsections only):
  - `output/WRITER_SELFLOOP_TODO.md`: strict writing gate (PASS/FAIL + which `sections/*.md` to rewrite)
  - `output/SECTION_LOGIC_REPORT.md`: thesis + connector density
  - `output/ARGUMENT_SELFLOOP_TODO.md`: argument chain + premise/definition consistency (ledgers are intermediate; never merged)
  - `output/CITATION_BUDGET_REPORT.md`: citation density suggestions

## Conversational Execution (0 to PDF)

```
You: Write me an agent LaTeX survey

↓ [C0-C1] Retrieve 1200+ candidates (target 1500+) → core set=300 (A150++ default; target global unique citations >=165; arXiv can backfill metadata)
↓ [C2] Build taxonomy + outline + mapping (NO PROSE) → pause at C2 for approval

You: Approve C2, continue

↓ [C3-C4] Build evidence substrate (paper notes + evidence packs + citations) (NO PROSE)
↓ [C5] Evidence-based writing → quality gate check

【PASS】→ output/DRAFT.md + latex/main.pdf ✓
【FAIL】→ output/QUALITY_GATE.md points to artifact needing fix

You (if FAIL): Fix the file (e.g., outline/evidence_drafts.jsonl), say "continue"
→ Resume from failed unit, no full restart needed
```

**Key principle**: C2-C4 enforce NO PROSE—build evidence substrate first; C5 writes prose; failures are point-fixable.

## Example Artifacts (v0.1, full intermediate outputs)

This version was generated by `gpt-5.2-xhigh` in Codex in ~2 hours, with only one human-in-the-loop intervention (at C2).

Path: `example/e2e-agent-survey-latex-verify-****TIMESTAMP/` (pipeline: `pipelines/arxiv-survey-latex.pipeline.md`).
Config (A150++ default): `draft_profile: survey` / `citation_target: recommended` / `evidence_mode: abstract` / `core_size: 300` / `per_subsection: 28` (see `queries.md`; global unique citations: hard>=150, default converge to recommended >=165).
Recommended default (align with the final deliverable): `draft_profile: survey` (default) or `draft_profile: deep` (stricter).
