```

---

## WHEN TRIGGERED - EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY

**DO NOT just display this documentation. EXECUTE the research flow immediately.**

### On Trigger Action:

1. **Extract the topic** from user's message
2. **Start Phase 1** - Use `AskUserQuestion` tool for interactive selection

---

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

**CALL THE `AskUserQuestion` TOOL IMMEDIATELY.**

DO NOT output text-based questions. INSTEAD, call the AskUserQuestion tool with JSON parameters.

---

### Language Detection
- Detect the language of user's input (topic query)
- Generate ALL question labels and descriptions in the SAME LANGUAGE as user input
- If Korean -> Korean options, If English -> English options, etc.

Use `AskUserQuestion` with these questions (combine into 1-4 question groups).
Translate all labels/descriptions to match user's language:

**English Example:**
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What aspects interest you most?",
      "header": "Focus",
      "options": [
        {"label": "Current state & trends", "description": "Latest developments, market status, key players"},
        {"label": "Technical deep-dive", "description": "Architecture, implementation, tech stack"},
        {"label": "Market analysis", "description": "Market size, growth rate, competition"},
        {"label": "All of the above (Recommended)", "description": "Comprehensive research - all aspects"}
      ],
      "multiSelect": false
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of deliverable do you want?",
      "header": "Output",
      "options": [
        {"label": "Comprehensive report (Recommended)", "description": "20-50+ pages, detailed analysis and insights"},
        {"label": "Executive summary", "description": "3-5 pages, key points only"},
        {"label": "Modular documents", "description": "Multiple documents by topic"}
      ],
      "multiSelect": false
    },
    {
      "question": "Who will read this research?",
      "header": "Audience",
      "options": [
        {"label": "Technical team/Developers", "description": "Include technical details"},
        {"label": "Business executives", "description": "Focus on strategic insights"},
        {"label": "Researchers/Academic", "description": "Academic citations and methodology"},
        {"label": "General audience", "description": "Easy explanations and overview"}
      ],
      "multiSelect": false
    },
    {
      "question": "Any source preferences?",
      "header": "Sources",
      "options": [
        {"label": "Academic/Papers", "description": "Peer-reviewed papers, conferences"},
        {"label": "Industry reports", "description": "Gartner, white papers, analyst reports"},
        {"label": "News/Current", "description": "Media, blogs, latest announcements"},
        {"label": "All sources (Recommended)", "description": "All reliable sources"}
      ],
      "multiSelect": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**Korean Example:**
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "어떤 측면에 관심이 있으신가요?",
      "header": "Focus",
      "options": [
        {"label": "현재 상태와 트렌드", "description": "최신 동향, 시장 현황, 주요 플레이어"},
        {"label": "기술 심층 분석", "description": "아키텍처, 구현 방법, 기술 스택"},
        {"label": "시장 분석", "description": "시장 규모, 성장률, 경쟁 구도"},
        {"label": "모두 포함 (Recommended)", "description": "종합 리서치 - 모든 측면 분석"}
      ],
      "multiSelect": false
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **After user responds**:
   - Create session folder: `RESEARCH/{topic}_{timestamp}/`
   - Initialize `state.json`
   - Execute Phase 2-7 sequentially
   - Use parallel background agents for searching
   - Deliver final report to `outputs/` folder

---

## The 7-Phase Deep Research Process

### Phase 1: Question Scoping
- Clarify the research question with the user
- Define output format and success criteria
- Identify constraints and desired tone
- Create unambiguous query with clear parameters

### Phase 2: Retrieval Planning
- Break main question into 3-5 subtopics
- Generate specific search queries per subtopic
- Select appropriate data sources
- Create research plan for user approval
- Use Graph of Thoughts to model research as operations

---

## DATE-AWARE QUERY GENERATION (CRITICAL)

**All search queries MUST include current date context for freshness.**

### Get Today's Date First
Before generating ANY search query, determine today's date from the system context.

### Query Generation Rules

1. **Always append year to queries:**
   - BAD: "AI code assistants market"
   - GOOD: "AI code assistants market 2026"
   - GOOD: "AI code assistants trends February 2026"

2. **Use recency operators:**
   - "after:2025" for Google
   - "since:2025" for news
   - "2025..2026" for date ranges

3. **Add freshness keywords:**
   - "latest", "recent", "current", "new"
   - "[current year] update"

4. **Example transformations:**
   | User Query | Generated Search Query |
   |------------|----------------------|
   | AI 코딩 어시스턴트 | AI 코딩 어시스턴트 2026 최신 동향 |
   | startup trends | startup trends 2026 latest |
   | React vs Vue | React vs Vue 2026 comparison |

5. **For academic/historical research:**
   - Still include current year for "state of" queries
   - Use date ranges: "climate change research 2020-2026"

### Search Query Template
```
[topic] [current_year] [freshness_keyword] [specific_aspect]
```

---

### Phase 3: Iterative Querying
- Execute searches systematically with parallel agents
- Navigate and extract relevant information
- Formulate new queries based on findings
- Use multiple search modalities (web, academic, code)

### Phase 4: Source Triangulation
- Compare findings across multiple sources
- Validate claims with cross-references (minimum 2 sources for key claims)
- Handle inconsistencies and note contradictions
- Assess source credibility with A-E ratings

### Phase 5: Knowledge Synthesis
- Structure content logically
- Write comprehensive sections
- Include inline citations for EVERY claim
- Add data visualizations when relevant

### Phase 6: Quality Assurance
- Check for hallucinations and errors
- Verify all citations match content
- Ensure completeness and clarity
- Apply Chain-of-Verification techniques

### Phase 7: Output & Packaging
- Format for optimal readability
- Include executive summary
- Create proper bibliography
- Export in requested format
- Optionally generate interactive website

---

## Multi-Agent Research Strategy

### Agent Deployment (Phase 3)

Deploy 3-5 parallel agents to maximize coverage:

| Agent Type | Count | Focus | Output |
|------------|-------|-------|--------|
| Web Research | 2-3 | Current info, trends, news | Structured summaries with source URLs |
| Academic/Technical | 1-2 | Papers, specs, methodology | Technical analysis with citations |
| Cross-Reference | 1 | Fact-checking, verification | Confidence ratings for key findings |

Launch multiple Task calls in a single response for parallel execution. Each agent receives a focused prompt with specific subtopic and citation requirements.

For detailed agent prompt templates and Graph of Thoughts integration:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/deep-research-main/references/agent_prompts.md`

---

## Tool Usage

Use whichever search and extraction tools are available. Prioritize: MCP tools (Firecrawl, Google Search, Exa) > Built-in tools (WebSearch, WebFetch) > Specialized tools (GitHub search, library docs).

Deploy parallel research agents using the Task tool with `run_in_background=True` for concurrent subtopic investigation.

For detailed tool strategy and code examples:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/deep-research-main/references/tool_strategy.md`

---

## Citation Requirements

Every factual claim MUST include inline citation.

### Mandatory Standards

1. **Author/Organization** - Who made this claim
2. **Date** - When published
3. **Source Title** - Name of paper, article, or report
4. **URL/DOI** - Direct link to verify
5. **Page Numbers** - For lengthy documents (when applicable)

### Source Quality Ratings

| Grade | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **A** | Peer-reviewed, systematic reviews, meta-analyses | Nature, Lancet, IEEE |
| **B** | Official docs, clinical guidelines, cohort studies | FDA, W3C, WHO |
| **C** | Expert opinion, case reports, industry reports | Gartner, conferences |
| **D** | Preliminary research, preprints, white papers | arXiv, company blogs |
| **E** | Anecdotal, theoretical, speculative | Social media, forums |

### Red Flags (Unreliable Sources)
- No author attribution
- Missing publication dates
- Broken or suspicious URLs
- Claims without data
- Conflicts of interest not disclosed
- Predatory journals
- Retracted papers

---

## Hallucination Prevention

### Core Strategies

1. **Always ground statements in source material**
   - Never claim without a verifiable source
   - If uncertain, state "Source needed" rather than guessing

2. **Use Chain-of-Verification for critical claims**
   - Generate verification questions
   - Search for answers independently
   - Only finalize when verified

3. **Cross-reference multiple sources**
   - Key findings need 2+ independent sources
   - Note when sources disagree

4. **Explicitly state uncertainty**
   - "According to [source]..." not "Studies show..."
   - Qualify preliminary or contested findings

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] Every claim has inline citation
- [ ] All URLs are accessible
- [ ] No orphan citations
- [ ] Contradictions acknowledged
- [ ] Source quality ratings applied

### Output Templates

Use the templates at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/deep-research-main/assets/templates/` for consistent formatting:

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `executive_summary.md` | Executive summary structure |
| `full_report_section.md` | Individual report section template |
| `bibliography.md` | Bibliography with quality distribution |
| `readme_research.md` | Research session README/navigation |
| `website_template.html` | Interactive web presentation |

---

## Structured Query Support

For precise research control, accept structured JSON queries following the schema at:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/deep-research-main/references/query_schema.json`

When a user provides a JSON object as input, parse it according to the schema and skip Phase 1 (Question Scoping) since requirements are already defined.

Example queries are available at:
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/deep-research-main/examples/`

---

## Resume Protocol

When resume is triggered:

1. List available sessions: `RESEARCH/*/state.json`
2. Load selected session's `state.json`
3. Check `progress` object for last completed phase
4. Resume from next pending phase
5. Continue execution loop

```python
for phase_num in range(1, 8):
    phase_key = f"phase_{phase_num}"
    if state["progress"][phase_key] == "in_progress":
        resume_phase(phase_num)
        break
    elif state["progress"][phase_key] == "pending":
        start_phase(phase_num)
        break
```

---

## Error Handling

### Phase Failures
1. Log error to `state.json` errors array
2. Mark phase as `failed` in progress
3. Notify user with details
4. Offer: Retry / Skip / Abort

### Network Failures
- Retry up to 3 times with backoff
- Log failed URLs to `sources/failed_urls.txt`
- Continue with available sources

### Token Limits
- Split long documents into chunks
- Save intermediate results frequently
- Use summarization for very long sources

---
