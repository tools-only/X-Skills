# Deepfake Detection & Media Authentication

Comprehensive framework for detecting synthetic media, analyzing manipulation artifacts, and establishing media provenance in the post-empirical era.

> **Key Insight**: Traditional detection methods (PRNU, IGH, DQ) are like **fingerprints**—helpful, but disputable. Cryptographic provenance (C2PA) is like a **DNA match**—mathematically certain (collision probability 2⁻²⁵⁶).

## When to Use

- Verifying authenticity of images or videos before publication
- Detecting AI-generated or manipulated media (deepfakes, face swaps, synthetic voices)
- Forensic analysis of suspicious media for legal or journalistic purposes
- Implementing automated media authentication pipelines
- Establishing content provenance and chain of custody
- Countering disinformation campaigns and Advanced Persistent Manipulators (APMs)

## 1. What Are Deepfakes?

### Definition

**Deepfakes** are synthetic media created using deep learning techniques—primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and Autoencoders—to generate or manipulate audiovisual content with a high degree of realism. The term combines "deep learning" and "fake."

### Types of Synthetic Media

| Type | Technology | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Face Swap** | Autoencoders, GANs | Replace one person's face with another in video |
| **Face Reenactment** | 3D Morphable Models | Animate a face with another person's expressions |
| **Voice Clone** | Text-to-Speech, Vocoder | Generate speech in someone's voice from text [[20]](#references) |
| **Lip Sync** | Audio-to-Video | Make someone appear to say different words |
| **Full Body Puppetry** | Pose Estimation | Control a person's body movements |
| **Fully Synthetic** | Diffusion, GANs | Generate non-existent people, scenes, events |

### Emerging Capabilities (2025-2026)

| Type | Advancement | Implication |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Face Swap** | One-shot swapping (single reference image), GHOST 2.0 [[24]](#references), DynamicFace [[25]](#references) | Minimal source material needed |
| **Face Reenactment** | Audio-driven animation, Neural Head Reenactment | Fully synthetic video calls |
| **Voice Clone** | Zero-shot cloning (no training on target), Emotional Voice Synthesis | Clone any voice instantly with emotion |
| **Lip Sync** | High-fidelity with Diffusion Models, Multilingual sync | Automatic dubbing across languages |
| **Full Body Puppetry** | 3D-aware motion transfer, Neural Body Avatars | Photorealistic real-time control |
| **Fully Synthetic** | Video Diffusion Models, Controllable Generation | Precise control over age, expression, gaze |

### The Entertaining Side

Deepfakes have legitimate and creative applications:

| Use Case | Example | Value |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Entertainment** | De-aging actors in films, posthumous performances | Artistic expression |
| **Satire & Parody** | Political satire, comedy sketches | Free speech, humor |
| **Education** | Historical figures "speaking" in documentaries | Engagement, learning |
| **Accessibility** | Real-time sign language avatars | Inclusion |
| **Gaming & VR** | Personalized avatars, NPC faces | Immersion |
| **Art & Expression** | Digital art, creative projects | Innovation |

> **Example**: The "This Person Does Not Exist" website showcases GAN-generated faces that fascinate users with the uncanny realism of non-existent people.

### The Dangerous Side

The same technology enables serious harms:

| Threat | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Non-Consensual Imagery** | Synthetic intimate content without consent | Psychological harm, harassment, reputation destruction |
| **Political Manipulation** | Fabricated speeches, fake scandals | Election interference, democratic erosion |
| **Financial Fraud** | CEO voice clones for wire transfer scams | Millions in losses per incident |
| **Evidence Fabrication** | Fake alibis, planted evidence | Obstruction of justice |
| **Liar's Dividend** | Dismissing real evidence as "deepfake" | Accountability evasion |
| **Identity Theft** | Bypassing facial recognition, KYC | Account takeover, fraud |
| **Disinformation Warfare** | State-sponsored synthetic media campaigns | Geopolitical destabilization |

> **Real Case (2024)**: WPP CEO Mark Read was targeted by a sophisticated deepfake voice clone attempting to authorize fraudulent transfers [[19]](#references). Deepfake fraud cases surged **1,740%** in North America between 2022-2023, with average losses exceeding $500,000 per incident [[18]](#references).

### Current Scale (2025-2026)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Deepfakes shared annually | **8 million** (2025) vs 500,000 (2023) | Industry estimates |
| Projected synthetic content | **90% of online content** by 2026 | Europol |
| Non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) | **98% of all deepfakes** | EU Commission |

> **Key Insight**: The exponential growth rate means detection systems face an ever-increasing volume challenge, reinforcing the need for proactive authentication (C2PA) over reactive detection.

### The Future of Deepfakes

| Timeline | Development | Implication |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Now (2026)** | Real-time video deepfakes, commoditized tools | Anyone can create convincing fakes |
| **Near Future** | Interactive deepfakes in video calls | Trust in live communication erodes |
| **Medium Term** | Undetectable synthetic media | Detection becomes probabilistic, not binary |
| **Long Term** | "Reality-as-a-Service" | Authenticated media becomes the norm, unsigned content is suspect |

### The Detection Arms Race

Recent research confirms the growing challenge of detection generalizability [[1]](#references):

```
Generation Quality:    ████████████████████░░░░  85% (2026)
Detection Accuracy:    █████████████░░░░░░░░░░░  55% (2026)
                       ↑ Gap widening over time
```

**Key Insight**: We are transitioning from a world where "seeing is believing" to one where "cryptographic proof is believing." The future lies not in perfect detection, but in **provenance infrastructure** (C2PA v2.3) that proves authenticity at creation [[15, 16]](#references). Traditional detection methods (PRNU, IGH, DQ) are like fingerprints—helpful, but disputable. Cryptographic provenance (C2PA) is like a DNA match—mathematically certain.

---

## 2. Strategic Context: The Post-Empirical Era

### The Crisis of Empirical Evidence (2026)

The boundary between authentic and synthetic media has effectively vanished. Trillion-parameter models have commoditized the generation of photorealistic synthetic content, transforming deepfakes from isolated experiments into an industrialized disinformation capability.

### The ABC Framework of Synthetic Media Threats

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **A - Actors** | Malicious generators of synthetic content | Nation-states, APMs (Advanced Persistent Manipulators), commercial disinformation services |
| **B - Behavior** | Deceptive patterns and tactics | Astroturfing with synthetic identities, coordinated inauthentic behavior |
| **C - Content** | The synthetic media itself | Deepfake videos, voice clones, GAN-generated faces, manipulated images |

### The 4D Disinformation Tactics

| Tactic | Description | Forensic Counter |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Dismiss** | Claim real evidence is fake ("Liar's Dividend") | Provenance verification, cryptographic attestation |
| **Distort** | Reframe authentic events with synthetic fragments | Semantic consistency analysis |
| **Distract** | Flood with synthetic noise to obscure truth | Scale-resistant automated detection |
| **Dismay** | Psychological operations through synthetic threats | Confidence scoring, sensemaking support |

---

## 3. System Architecture

### LLM Integration Strategy

The skill implements a hierarchical model structure for forensic analysis:

| Role | Model | Version | Function |
|------|-------|---------|----------|
| **Lead** | Claude Opus | 4.5 | Complex synthesis of forensic data, multimodal analysis, report generation |
| **Validation** | Gemini Pro | 3.0 | Cross-validation of detection results, second opinion on edge cases |
| **Reasoning** | GLM Pro Thinking | 4.7 | Logical verification of causal chains, step-by-step reasoning for forensic conclusions |

#### Model Selection Rationale

- **Claude Opus 4.5**: Best-in-class for nuanced multimodal analysis and synthesizing complex forensic evidence into coherent reports
- **Gemini Pro 3.0**: Strong visual understanding for cross-validating image/video analysis results
- **GLM Pro Thinking 4.7**: Chain-of-thought reasoning for transparent forensic logic that can be audited

### Architecture Requirements

1. **Asynchronous Processing Pipeline**: Handle high token counts from multimodal analysis
2. **Vector Database for CRF Profiles**: Store and query Camera Response Function signatures
3. **RAG Integration**: Access forensic reference databases during inference
4. **Tool Integration**: ffmpeg, ExifTool, ImageMagick for low-level signal processing

## 5. Forensic Detection Criteria

### Criterion A: Sensor Fingerprints (PRNU/PCE)

Photo-Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) is a sensor-specific noise pattern that acts as a biometric fingerprint for cameras.

#### Metric: Peak to Correlation Energy (PCE)

```python
# Conceptual PRNU/PCE calculation
def calculate_pce(image: np.ndarray, reference_prnu: np.ndarray) -> float:
    """
    Calculate Peak-to-Correlation-Energy for PRNU matching.
    
    Returns:
        PCE value > 60 indicates high confidence match
        PCE value 40-60 indicates moderate confidence
        PCE value < 40 indicates low confidence or mismatch
    """
    noise_residual = extract_noise_residual(image)
    correlation = correlate_2d(noise_residual, reference_prnu)
    peak = np.max(correlation)
    energy = np.mean(correlation**2)
    return peak**2 / energy
```

#### PRNU Limitations (Wronski Effect)

Modern computational photography (multi-frame capture, super-resolution) breaks the direct sensor-to-pixel mapping [[22, 23]](#references):

| Device Era | PRNU Reliability | Notes |
|------------|------------------|-------|
| Pre-2018 DSLRs | High | Direct sensor output |
| 2018-2022 Smartphones | Medium | Some computational processing |
| 2023+ Smartphones | Low | Heavy multi-frame HDR, AI enhancement |
| Synthetic (GAN/Diffusion) | None | No physical sensor involved |

### Criterion B: Noise-Intensity Relationship & IGH

The Intensity Gradient Histogram (IGH) classifies the relationship between local intensity and noise, exploiting Camera Response Function (CRF) physics.

```python
def analyze_igh_profile(image: np.ndarray) -> dict:
    """
    Analyze Intensity Gradient Histogram for CRF consistency.
    
    Synthetic blur (portrait mode) destroys the statistical harmony
    of the CRF model, detectable via IGH asymmetry analysis.
    """
    gradients = compute_intensity_gradients(image)
    
    # Authentic optical blur: asymmetric gradient distribution
    # Synthetic blur: symmetric Gaussian distribution
    symmetry_score = measure_gradient_symmetry(gradients)
    
    return {
        "gradient_histogram": gradients,
        "symmetry_score": symmetry_score,
        "classification": "authentic" if symmetry_score < 0.7 else "synthetic"
    }
```

### Criterion C: Geometric & Optical Blur Analysis

Physical law: Due to CRF non-linearity, optically blurred edges are asymmetric. Software Gaussian filters produce symmetric profiles.

| Blur Type | Gradient Profile | Detection Method |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Optical (lens) | Asymmetric | IGH analysis |
| Digital (software) | Symmetric | IGH analysis |
| Depth-of-field (real) | Varies with distance | 3D consistency check |
| Portrait mode (fake) | Uniform application | Edge discontinuity detection |

### Criterion D: Compression Artifacts (Double JPEG / DQ)

Double Quantization (DQ) effects serve as primary evidence for multiple save operations, enabling splicing localization.

```python
def generate_dq_probability_map(image: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Generate Double Quantization probability map.
    
    Spliced regions show different quantization histories,
    creating detectable statistical anomalies.
    """
    dct_blocks = compute_dct_blocks(image)
    q_estimates = estimate_quantization_tables(dct_blocks)
    
    # Probability map highlights regions with different
    # compression histories (splicing indicators)
    prob_map = detect_quantization_inconsistencies(q_estimates)
    
    return prob_map  # Heatmap: red = likely manipulation
```

---

## 6. Video-Specific Detection

Video deepfake detection requires analysis of temporal consistency, which current research shows remains challenging for generalization across different manipulation methods [[1, 4]](#references).

### Visual Detection Indicators (Human Review)

Before algorithmic analysis, trained reviewers check for these telltale signs:

| Indicator | What to Look For | Why It Happens |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Face Boundaries** | Flickering edges, face "floating" over body | Imperfect blending between swapped face and original |
| **Blinking** | No blinking, asymmetric blinking, stiff eyes | Early models lacked blink training; still imperfect |
| **Lip Sync** | Delays on plosives (p, b, m sounds) | Audio-visual alignment is computationally hard |
| **Shadows & Light** | Multiple shadow directions, inconsistent lighting | Composited elements from different light sources |
| **Eye Reflections** | Different scenes reflected in each eye | Synthesized eyes don't share real-world reflection |
| **Hair Details** | Smooth contours, "melting" strands, clipping | Fine details are hardest for generators |

> **Best Practice**: Slow down video to 25% speed and examine frame-by-frame. Artifacts become more visible when temporal smoothing is removed.

### Temporal Consistency Analysis

```python
def analyze_temporal_artifacts(video_path: str) -> dict:
    """
    Detect temporal inconsistencies in video deepfakes.
    
    Face-swap deepfakes often show:
    - Flickering at face boundaries
    - Inconsistent lighting between frames
    - Unnatural head pose transitions
    """
    frames = extract_frames(video_path)
    
    results = {
        "face_boundary_flickering": detect_boundary_flickering(frames),
        "lighting_consistency": analyze_lighting_consistency(frames),
        "pose_smoothness": measure_pose_transitions(frames),
        "blink_analysis": detect_blink_patterns(frames),  # Early deepfakes lacked blinking
        "audio_visual_sync": check_lip_sync_accuracy(video_path)
    }
    
    return results
```

### GAN & Diffusion Model Fingerprint Detection

Modern detection must address both GAN-based and diffusion model-generated images. Recent research demonstrates that diffusion models leave distinct artifacts detectable via uncertainty estimation [[5]](#references) and characteristic photorealism patterns [[6]](#references).

```python
def detect_gan_fingerprints(image: np.ndarray) -> dict:
    """
    Detect characteristic patterns left by generative architectures.
    
    Different families (StyleGAN, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, Midjourney)
    leave distinct frequency-domain artifacts.
    """
    fft = compute_fft_spectrum(image)
    
    # GANs often produce checkerboard patterns in FFT
    checkerboard_score = detect_checkerboard_artifacts(fft)
    
    # Spectral analysis for GAN-specific signatures
    gan_signatures = match_known_gan_spectra(fft)
    
    return {
        "checkerboard_score": checkerboard_score,
        "suspected_generator": gan_signatures.get("best_match"),
        "confidence": gan_signatures.get("confidence")
    }
```

---

## 7. Semantic Forensics (SemaFor)

When pixel-level artifacts are masked, focus on semantic inconsistencies. This approach was pioneered by the DARPA SemaFor program (2020-2024), which has since transitioned technologies to operational government use [[12, 13, 14]](#references).

### Cross-Modal Consistency Checks

| Check | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Shadow Physics | Verify shadow directions match single light source | Multiple shadow angles in composite |
| Reflection Consistency | Check reflections match scene geometry | Eyes reflecting different scenes |
| Perspective Geometry | Verify vanishing points are consistent | Impossible architectural angles |
| Audio-Visual Sync | Lip movements match phoneme timing [[7, 8]](#references) | Desync in voice clone overlays |
| Temporal Plausibility | Metadata matches claimed time/location | Weather, daylight inconsistent with timestamp |

### Example: Shadow Analysis

```python
def analyze_shadow_consistency(image: np.ndarray) -> dict:
    """
    Detect physically impossible shadow configurations.
    
    A single light source produces shadows in consistent directions.
    Composited images often have inconsistent shadow angles.
    """
    shadows = detect_shadows(image)
    objects = detect_objects(image)
    
    shadow_vectors = []
    for obj, shadow in zip(objects, shadows):
        vector = compute_shadow_vector(obj, shadow)
        shadow_vectors.append(vector)
    
    # All vectors should converge to consistent light source
    consistency_score = measure_vector_convergence(shadow_vectors)
    
    return {
        "shadow_vectors": shadow_vectors,
        "consistency_score": consistency_score,
        "physically_plausible": consistency_score > 0.85
    }
```

## 8. Authenticity Scoring System

### Analysis Layer Weighting

Based on scientific reliability of each method (from webconsulting.at forensics research):

| Analysis Layer | Weight | Rationale |
|----------------|--------|-----------|
| **Signal Analysis** | 45% | Objective forensic signals: noise patterns, compression artifacts, frequency analysis. Hybrid approaches achieve F1 scores of 0.96 on benchmarks |
| **Metadata Analysis** | 35% | EXIF provenance chain. 62% of images have camera-specific signatures, 99% are manufacturer-identifiable |
| **Semantic Analysis** | 20% | AI-based artifact detection. Only 58% accuracy on standard benchmarks—OpenAI discontinued their detector in 2023 due to low accuracy |
| **C2PA (Bonus)** | +25-40 points | Cryptographic proof. Only unforgeable method. Combined with AI detection reduces false positives by 41% |

> **Important**: Without C2PA verification, maximum achievable grade is 2 ("No manipulation indicators"). Grade 1 ("Provenance cryptographically verified") requires a validated signature chain.

### Probability to Grade Mapping

| Authenticity % | Grade | Interpretation |
|----------------|-------|----------------|
| 90 - 100% | 1 (Excellent) | Evidence-based authenticity: Valid PRNU/PCE fingerprint; absence of DQ artifacts |
| 75 - 89% | 2 (Good) | Probably authentic: Consistent IGH profiles; minor deviations from standard compression |
| 50 - 74% | 3 (Satisfactory) | Hybrid content detected: Requires human-in-the-loop verification |
| 35 - 49% | 4 (Adequate) | Significant statistical anomalies: Noise profile inconsistencies indicate local editing |
| 20 - 34% | 5 (Poor) | High manipulation probability: Positive splicing detection via DQ maps |
| < 20% | 6 (Fail) | Confirmed forgery: Forensic evidence of synthetic generation (GAN fingerprints) or physical impossibilities |

### Composite Scoring Algorithm

```python
def calculate_authenticity_score(media_path: str) -> dict:
    """
    Calculate composite authenticity score from multiple forensic signals.
    """
    image = load_media(media_path)
    
    scores = {
        "prnu_pce": analyze_prnu(image),           # Weight: 0.25
        "igh_profile": analyze_igh_profile(image), # Weight: 0.20
        "dq_artifacts": detect_dq_artifacts(image), # Weight: 0.20
        "gan_fingerprints": detect_gan_fingerprints(image), # Weight: 0.15
        "semantic_consistency": check_semantic_consistency(image), # Weight: 0.20
    }
    
    weights = [0.25, 0.20, 0.20, 0.15, 0.20]
    composite = sum(s * w for s, w in zip(scores.values(), weights))
    
    return {
        "authenticity_probability": composite,
        "grade": map_to_grade(composite),
        "detailed_scores": scores,
        "confidence_interval": calculate_confidence(scores)
    }
```

## 9. Content Provenance (C2PA / CAI)

### C2PA Steering Committee (2026)

The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity is governed by major technology and media companies:

| Member | Role |
|--------|------|
| **Adobe** | Founding member, CAI lead |
| **BBC** | Media organization representative |
| **Google** | Platform integration |
| **Meta** | Social platform adoption |
| **Microsoft** | Enterprise integration (365) |
| **OpenAI** | AI generator signing (DALL-E, ChatGPT) |
| **Publicis Groupe** | Advertising industry adoption |
| **Sony** | Hardware integration (cameras) |
| **Truepic** | Mobile authentication pioneer |

### Content Credentials: The CR Icon

**C2PA** is the technical standard. **Content Credentials** is the user-facing implementation with the visible "CR" icon.

| What the CR Icon Shows | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Creator** | Who created the media (camera, person, AI) |
| **Software** | What software was used for editing |
| **AI Disclosure** | Whether AI was used for generation |
| **Edit History** | What editing steps occurred |

> **Key Feature**: All assertions are cryptographically signed. Changing even **one pixel** invalidates the signature—manipulation is immediately detectable.

### Industry Adoption (2025-2026)

C2PA is rapidly becoming the industry standard. Current adoption landscape:

| Category | Adopters | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **AI Generators** | DALL-E 3, Adobe Firefly, Google Gemini | Auto-sign all outputs |
| **Software** | Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom | Cryptographic edit history |
| **Professional Cameras** | Leica M11-P, Sony (select models) | Sign at capture |
| **Camera Manufacturers** | Nikon, Canon | Following (announced) |
| **Smartphones** | Google Pixel 10 (2025/26) | Native C2PA support |
| **Mobile OEMs** | Samsung Galaxy | Following (announced) |
| **Enterprise** | Microsoft 365 | Mandatory AI watermarks (2026) |

> **Prognosis (3-5 years)**: For media organizations and government agencies: Without cryptographic provenance, no file will be considered trustworthy.

## 11. Defense Strategies

### Technical Controls

| Control | Implementation | Effectiveness |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| C2PA/CAI Validation | Require provenance for high-stakes media | High (when available) |
| Automated Screening | Deploy detection pipeline for inbound media | Medium (arms race) |
| Multi-Signal Fusion | Combine PRNU, IGH, DQ, semantic signals | High |
| Human-in-the-Loop | Expert review for Grade 3-4 cases | High |

### Organizational Inoculation

1. **Pre-bunking**: Educate stakeholders about deepfake capabilities before exposure
2. **Source Triangulation**: Verify claims through multiple independent sources
3. **Temporal Delay**: Wait for verification before amplifying uncertain content
4. **Provenance Requirement**: Mandate C2PA for critical communications

### Response When Targeted (Personal Deepfakes)

If you or your client are depicted in a deepfake:

| Step | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Preserve Evidence** | Screenshot with timestamp, save URL, download file |
| 2 | **Platform Takedown** | Report to platform using manipulation/deepfake reporting tools |
| 3 | **Legal Assessment** | Consult attorney for jurisdiction-specific remedies |
| 4 | **Support Resources** | Contact victim support organizations |

#### Legal Framework (Austria)

| Statute | Protection | Application |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **§ 78 UrhG** | Recht am eigenen Bild (Right to own image) | Unauthorized use of likeness |
| **§ 107c StGB** | Cybermobbing | Persistent harassment via digital means |
| **§ 120a StGB** | Unbefugte Bildaufnahmen | Intimate imagery without consent |

**Austrian Resources**:
- [Saferinternet.at Helpline](https://www.saferinternet.at/helpline) - Expert counseling
- [Saferinternet.at Unterrichtsmaterialien](https://www.saferinternet.at/zielgruppen/lehrende) - Teaching materials ("Wahr oder falsch im Internet")
- Rat auf Draht: **147** (24/7 hotline for young people)

## 13. Checklists

### Pre-Analysis Checklist

- [ ] Obtain original file (avoid screenshots, re-uploads)
- [ ] Preserve file hash (SHA-256) for chain of custody
- [ ] Document source and context of media
- [ ] Check for C2PA/CAI provenance data
- [ ] Identify claimed device/source for PRNU matching

### Analysis Checklist

- [ ] Run PRNU/PCE analysis (if reference available)
- [ ] Generate IGH profile and classify blur types
- [ ] Create DQ probability map for splicing detection
- [ ] Analyze for GAN fingerprints (FFT spectrum)
- [ ] Check semantic consistency (shadows, reflections, physics)
- [ ] For video: temporal consistency, audio-visual sync
- [ ] Calculate composite authenticity score

### Reporting Checklist

- [ ] Document all findings with confidence levels
- [ ] Include visualizations (DQ maps, FFT spectra)
- [ ] Provide grade interpretation with caveats
- [ ] List limitations of analysis
- [ ] Recommend human review for borderline cases

## 14. Limitations & Caveats

### Known Detection Challenges

| Challenge | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Computational imaging (HDR+, Night Sight) | Destroys PRNU | Rely on semantic analysis |
| Social media compression | Removes fine artifacts | Focus on coarse-grained signals |
| Adversarial attacks on detectors | Evades specific models | Multi-model ensemble |
| Rapid GAN evolution | Outdated fingerprints | Continuous model updates |
| **Metadata stripping** | Screenshots, re-uploads remove C2PA | Invisible watermarks coupled with C2PA |

> **C2PA Challenge**: Screenshots and social media uploads can strip metadata ("stripping attack"). The industry is developing invisible watermarks that survive re-encoding and link back to C2PA manifests.

### Ethical Considerations

1. **False Positives**: Incorrectly flagging authentic media can cause harm
2. **Dual Use**: Detection research enables better synthesis
3. **Automation Bias**: Over-reliance on automated verdicts
4. **Privacy**: PRNU databases can identify individuals

### The Liar's Dividend

> The mere existence of deepfakes allows bad actors to dismiss authentic evidence as fake. Detection tools must be communicated carefully to avoid amplifying this effect.
