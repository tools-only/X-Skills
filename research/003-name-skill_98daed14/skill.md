# Deep Research

Enhanced research engine for topics where training data is outdated.

## Quick Start

### Standard Mode
```
CLASSIFY → LANDSCAPE SCAN → SCOPE → HYPOTHESIZE → PLAN → [PLAN PREVIEW*] → RETRIEVE
→ GAP ANALYSIS → TRIANGULATE → SYNTHESIZE → RED TEAM → SELF-CRITIQUE → PACKAGE
```
*Deep+ tier only

### LANDSCAPE SCAN (MANDATORY - Before Anything Else)
```
[Search for OVERVIEW first - NO known entity names in query!]
WebSearch: "[topic] landscape overview [current year]"
WebSearch: "top [topic] list [current year]"
WebSearch: "[topic] ecosystem players [current year]"

❌ WRONG: "DeepSeek Qwen performance 2025" (uses names you already know)
✅ RIGHT: "China open source LLM models list 2025" (discovers what exists)

→ Extract ALL entity names from results
→ List: Discovered (new to you) vs Confirmed (you knew)
→ THEN proceed to SCOPE with complete picture
```
**Why:** You cannot research what you don't know exists. Scan the landscape FIRST.

### Creative Mode
```
ABSTRACT → MAP (3-5 domains) → SEARCH → GENERALIZE → SYNTHESIZE
```
**Trigger:** "creative mode", "cross-industry", "what do others do"

## Classification

| Type | When | Process |
|------|------|---------|
| A | Single fact | WebSearch → Answer |
| B | Multi-fact | 3 phases |
| C | Judgment needed | 6 phases |
| D | Novel/conflicting | Full + Red Team |

## Intensity Tiers

| Tier | Sources | When |
|------|---------|------|
| Quick | 5-10 | Simple question |
| Standard | 10-20 | Multi-faceted |
| Deep | 20-30 | Novel, high stakes |
| Exhaustive | 30+ | Critical decision |

## Core Rules

### Parallel Search (MANDATORY)
```
[Single message]
WebSearch: "[topic] 2025"
WebSearch: "[topic] limitations"
WebSearch: "[topic] vs alternatives"
```

### Claim Types

| Type | Requirements |
|------|--------------|
| **C1** | Quote + 2+ sources + confidence + reasoning |
| **C2** | Citation required |
| **C3** | Cite if contested |

### Confidence Format (C1 claims)
```
**Claim:** [Statement]
**Confidence:** HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
**Reason:** [Why]
**Sources:** [1][2]
```

### Anti-Hallucination
- Every C1 cites [N] immediately
- Use "According to [1]..."
- Admit: "No sources found for X"

## URL Fallback

If WebFetch returns 403:
```bash
curl -s --max-time 60 "https://r.jina.ai/https://example.com"
```

## GitHub Repository Research

When research reveals **interesting GitHub repositories** that could provide deeper insights:

1. **ASK user before cloning:**
   ```
   "เจอ repo ที่น่าสนใจ: [repo-name] — ต้องการให้ clone มาศึกษา code โดยละเอียดไหมคะ?"
   ```

2. **If user agrees, clone to dedicated research folder:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /mnt/d/githubresearch && cd /mnt/d/githubresearch && git clone [repo-url]
   ```

3. **Key files to read:**
   - `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` — dependencies, entry points
   - `src/index.ts` or `src/main.py` — main logic
   - `src/types/` — data structures
   - `README.md` — overview

**Why:** Cloned repos allow deeper code analysis than WebFetch summaries.

## Finding Details in References

| Topic | File | Grep Pattern |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Phase details | [standard-mode.md](./references/standard-mode.md) | `grep -n "^## Phase"` |
| Creative mode | [creative-mode.md](./references/creative-mode.md) | `grep -n "^## Phase C"` |
| Agent prompts | [agent-templates.md](./references/agent-templates.md) | `grep -n "^## "` |
| Progress/recovery | [progress-recovery.md](./references/progress-recovery.md) | — |
| Report template | [report_template.md](./assets/report_template.md) | — |
| **Query generation** | [query-framework.md](./references/query-framework.md) | QUEST Matrix |
| **Perspective audit** | [perspective-checklist.md](./references/perspective-checklist.md) | COMPASS Checklist |
| **Researcher thinking** | [researcher-thinking.md](./references/researcher-thinking.md) | THINK Protocol |

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/validate_report.py` | 9-check quality validation |

## Output File (MANDATORY)

After completing research, **ALWAYS save to markdown file**:

```
research/[topic-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md
```

**Example:** `research/china-opensource-ai-2025-01-04.md`

- Create `research/` folder if it doesn't exist
- **Why:** Research takes effort. Save it for future reference.
