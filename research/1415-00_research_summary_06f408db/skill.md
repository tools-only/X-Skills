### Assessment

This research provides a solid foundation for understanding Michael Jackson's popularity in China during 1990-2009. The framework is comprehensive, the analysis is logical, and the documentation is thorough. However, the critical limitation—lack of primary source access due to tool constraints—means that all specific quantitative data and many detailed claims require verification through archive access and expert consultation.
