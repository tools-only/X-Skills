**Research Date**: December 25, 2025
**Status**: Preliminary methodology - Framework established

## I. Research Design

### Research Questions

**Primary Question**:
How did Michael Jackson achieve peak popularity in China during the 1990s through 2009?

**Secondary Questions**:
1. What were the major television broadcast events that introduced MJ to Chinese audiences?
2. How did album distribution (official and pirated) affect his market penetration?
3. What role did Chinese media (print and online) play in building and maintaining his popularity?
4. How did the internet and digital technologies transform MJ's reach in China?
5. What was the nature and evolution of Chinese fan culture surrounding MJ?
6. How did controversies and legal issues affect his popularity in China?
7. What was MJ's broader cultural impact on Chinese popular music and culture?

### Hypotheses

**Primary Hypothesis**:
Michael Jackson's popularity in China during 1990-2009 was driven by a combination of strategic television broadcasts, widespread pirated distribution, later supplemented by internet proliferation, creating a sustained cultural influence that transcended political and language barriers.

**Supporting Hypotheses**:
1. **Television Hypothesis**: Major television broadcasts (particularly the 1992 Bucharest concert) served as crucial breakthrough moments for mainstream awareness.

2. **Piracy Paradox Hypothesis**: Pirated distribution, while undermining official sales, actually expanded MJ's total reach and built the foundation for later legitimate sales.

3. **Internet Acceleration Hypothesis**: Post-2000 internet growth dramatically accelerated MJ's popularity by bypassing physical distribution limitations.

4. **Cultural Bridge Hypothesis**: MJ's visual performance style allowed him to transcend language barriers and serve as a bridge between Western and Chinese pop culture.

5. **Fan Community Hypothesis**: Organized fan communities played a crucial role in sustaining MJ's popularity during periods of limited new content or negative publicity.

## II. Theoretical Framework

### Cultural Globalization Theory

**Concept**:
The research draws on theories of cultural globalization, particularly:
- **Cultural Diffusion**: How cultural elements spread across societies

- **Cultural Hybridity**: Blending of global and local cultural elements

**Application to MJ in China**:
- MJ as global cultural icon penetrating Chinese market
- Adaptation of MJ fandom within Chinese cultural context
- Blending of Western pop performance with Chinese cultural expressions

### Media and Communication Theory

**Key Concepts**:
- **Media Richness**: Visual media (TV, music videos) as rich communication channels
- **Agenda-Setting**: Media coverage influencing public perception
- **Two-Step Flow**: Fan clubs as opinion leaders
- **Network Society**: Internet-enabled fan communities

**Application**:
- Visual media allowed MJ to transcend language barriers
- Media coverage shaped how Chinese audiences understood MJ
- Fan communities facilitated spread of MJ fandom
- Internet created networked fan culture

### Popular Music Studies

**Framework**:
