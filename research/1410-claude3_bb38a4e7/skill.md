# Deep Research Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for conducting deep research using the methodologies from deepresearchprocess.md and the Graph of Thoughts (GoT) framework.

## Understanding Deep Research

Deep research is an AI-driven approach that autonomously conducts multi-step research by:
- Iteratively searching, reading, and analyzing information
- Performing multi-step reasoning
- Compiling findings with explicit citations
- Using Graph of Thoughts for complex problem-solving

## The 7-Phase Deep Research Process

### Phase 1: Question Scoping
- Clarify the research question with the user
- Define output format and success criteria
- Identify constraints and desired tone
- Create unambiguous query with clear parameters

### Phase 2: Retrieval Planning
- Break main question into subtopics
- Generate specific search queries
- Select appropriate data sources
- Create research plan for user approval
- Use GoT to model the research as a graph of operations

### Phase 3: Iterative Querying
- Execute searches systematically
- Navigate and extract relevant information
- Formulate new queries based on findings
- Use multiple search modalities (web search, file analysis, etc.)
- Apply GoT operations for complex reasoning

### Phase 4: Source Triangulation
- Compare findings across multiple sources
- Validate claims with cross-references
- Handle inconsistencies
- Assess source credibility
- Use GoT scoring functions to evaluate information quality

### Phase 5: Knowledge Synthesis
- Structure content logically
- Write comprehensive sections
- Include inline citations for every claim
- Add data visualizations when relevant
- Use GoT to optimize information organization

### Phase 6: Quality Assurance
- Check for hallucinations and errors
- Verify all citations match content
- Ensure completeness and clarity
- Apply Chain-of-Verification techniques
- Use GoT ground truth operations for validation

### Phase 7: Output & Packaging
- Format for optimal readability
- Include executive summary
- Create proper bibliography
- Export in requested format

## Graph of Thoughts Integration

The GoT framework enhances deep research by:
1. **Modeling Research as Graph Operations**: Each research step becomes a node in the graph
2. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple research paths can be explored simultaneously
3. **Scoring & Optimization**: Information quality can be scored and optimized
4. **Backtracking**: Poor research paths can be abandoned for better alternatives

### GoT Operations for Deep Research:
- **Generate**: Create search queries and hypotheses
- **Score**: Evaluate information quality and relevance
- **GroundTruth**: Verify facts against authoritative sources
- **Aggregate**: Combine findings from multiple sources
- **Improve**: Refine research questions based on findings

## Implementation Tools

### Core Tools:
1. **WebSearch**: Built-in web search capability for finding relevant sources
2. **WebFetch**: For extracting and analyzing content from specific URLs
3. **Read/Write**: For managing research documents locally
4. **Task**: For spawning autonomous agents for complex multi-step operations
5. **TodoWrite/TodoRead**: For tracking research progress

### MCP Server Tools:
1. **mcp__filesystem__**: File system operations (read, write, search files)
2. **mcp__puppeteer__**: Browser automation for dynamic web content
   - Navigate to pages requiring JavaScript
   - Take screenshots of web content
   - Extract data from interactive websites
   - Fill forms and interact with web elements

### Web Research Strategy:
- **Primary**: Use WebSearch tool for general web searches
- **Secondary**: Use WebFetch for extracting content from specific URLs
- **Advanced**: Use mcp__puppeteer__ for sites requiring interaction or JavaScript rendering
- **Note**: When MCP web fetch tools become available, prefer them over WebFetch as per documentation

### Data Analysis:
- Python code execution for data processing
- Visualization tools for creating charts/graphs
- Statistical analysis for quantitative research

## Multi-Agent Research Strategy

### Overview
To maximize research efficiency and coverage, spawn multiple Task agents to work on different aspects of the research simultaneously. This parallel approach mirrors how a research team would divide work among specialists.

### Agent Deployment Strategy

#### Phase 2 (Retrieval Planning) - Agent Distribution:
1. **Topic Decomposition Agent**: Break main question into 3-5 subtopics
2. **Launch Parallel Research Agents**: 
   - One agent per subtopic/research angle
   - Each agent gets specific research objectives
   - Agents work independently but share findings

#### Phase 3 (Iterative Querying) - Parallel Execution:

**Agent Type 1: Web Research Agents** (3-5 agents)
- Focus: Current information, trends, news
- Objective: Gather recent developments and real-world data
- Output: Structured summaries with source URLs

**Agent Type 2: Academic/Technical Agent** (1-2 agents)
- Focus: Research papers, technical specifications
- Objective: Find theoretical foundations and methodologies
- Output: Technical analysis with proper citations

**Agent Type 3: Cross-Reference Agent** (1 agent)
- Focus: Fact-checking and verification
- Objective: Validate claims across sources
- Output: Confidence ratings for key findings

### Implementation Instructions

#### Step 1: Create Research Plan
Break down the main research question into specific subtopics:
- Subtopic 1: Current state and trends
- Subtopic 2: Key challenges and limitations
- Subtopic 3: Future developments and predictions
- Subtopic 4: Case studies and real-world applications
- Subtopic 5: Expert opinions and industry perspectives

#### Step 2: Launch Parallel Agents
Use multiple Task tool invocations in a single response to launch agents simultaneously. Each agent should receive:
- Clear description of their research focus
- Specific instructions on what to find
- Expected output format

#### Step 3: Coordinate Results
After agents complete their tasks:
- Compile findings from all agents
- Identify overlaps and contradictions
- Synthesize into coherent narrative
- Maintain source attribution from each agent

### Example Multi-Agent Deployment

When researching a topic like "AI in Healthcare", deploy agents as follows:

**Agent 1**: "Research current AI applications in healthcare"
**Agent 2**: "Find challenges and ethical concerns in medical AI"
**Agent 3**: "Investigate future AI healthcare innovations"
**Agent 4**: "Gather case studies of successful AI healthcare implementations"
**Agent 5**: "Cross-reference and verify key statistics about AI healthcare impact"

### Best Practices for Multi-Agent Research

1. **Clear Task Boundaries**: Each agent should have a distinct focus to minimize redundancy
2. **Comprehensive Prompts**: Include all necessary context in agent prompts
3. **Parallel Execution**: Launch all agents in one response for maximum efficiency
4. **Result Integration**: Plan how to merge findings before launching agents
5. **Quality Control**: Always include at least one verification agent

### Agent Prompt Templates

**General Research Agent Template**:
"Research [specific aspect] of [main topic]. Use the following tools:
1. Start with WebSearch to find relevant sources
2. Use WebFetch to extract content from promising URLs
3. If sites require JavaScript, use mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate and screenshot
Focus on finding:
- Recent information (prioritize last 2 years)

```

**Direct Quotes:**
```
"Exact quote from source" (Author, Year, p. XX)
```

### Source Verification Protocol

1. **Primary Sources Only** - Link to original research, not secondary reporting
2. **Archive Links** - For time-sensitive content, include archive.org links
3. **Multiple Confirmations** - Critical claims need 2+ independent sources
4. **Conflicting Data** - Note when sources disagree and explain discrepancies
5. **Source Quality Ratings**:
   - **A**: Peer-reviewed RCTs, systematic reviews, meta-analyses
   - **B**: Cohort studies, case-control studies, clinical guidelines
   - **C**: Expert opinion, case reports, mechanistic studies
   - **D**: Preliminary research, preprints, conference abstracts
   - **E**: Anecdotal, theoretical, or speculative

### Traceability Requirements

**For Medical/Health Information:**
- PubMed ID (PMID) when available
- Clinical trial registration numbers
- FDA/regulatory body references
- Version/update dates for guidelines

**For Genetic Information:**
- dbSNP rs numbers
- Gene database links (OMIM, GeneCards)

### Source Documentation Structure

Each research output must include:

1. **Inline Citations** - Throughout the text
2. **References Section** - Full bibliography at end
3. **Source Quality Table** - Rating each source A-E
4. **Verification Checklist** - Confirming each claim is sourced
5. **Data Availability** - Where raw data can be accessed

### Example Implementation

**Poor Citation:**
"Studies show that metformin reduces diabetes risk."

**Proper Citation:**
"The Diabetes Prevention Program demonstrated that metformin reduces diabetes incidence by 31% over 2.8 years in high-risk individuals (Knowler et al., 2002, NEJM, PMID: 11832527, https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa012512)"

### Red Flags for Unreliable Sources

- No author attribution
- Missing publication dates
- Broken or suspicious URLs
- Claims without data
- Conflicts of interest not disclosed
- Predatory journals
- Retracted papers (check RetractionWatch)

### Agent Instructions for Citations

When deploying research agents, include:
```
"For every factual claim, provide:
1. Direct quote or specific data point
2. Author/organization name
3. Publication year
4. Full title
5. Direct URL/DOI
6. Confidence rating (High/Medium/Low)
Never make claims without sources. If uncertain, state 'Source needed' rather than guessing."
```

## Mitigation Strategies

### Hallucination Prevention:
- Always ground statements in source material
- Use Chain-of-Verification for critical claims
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Explicitly state uncertainty when appropriate

### Coverage Optimization:
- Use diverse search queries
- Check multiple perspectives
- Include recent sources (check dates)
- Acknowledge limitations and gaps

### Citation Management:
- Track source URLs and access dates
- Quote relevant passages verbatim when needed
- Maintain source-to-statement mapping
- Use consistent citation format
