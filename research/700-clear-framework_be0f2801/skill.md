# CLEAR Framework

Clavix applies the CLEAR framework to evaluate and improve every prompt and PRD it touches. CLEAR was developed by Dr. Leo Lo and published in the _Journal of Academic Librarianship_ (July 2023). The acronym stands for Concise, Logical, Explicit, Adaptive, and Reflective.

## Components

| Component      | Focus                         | Typical improvements                                                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concise**    | Reduce noise and pleasantries | Remove filler, tighten language, emphasize action verbs                 |
| **Logical**    | Improve flow and ordering     | Restructure prompts into context → requirements → constraints → outputs |
| **Explicit**   | Clarify expectations          | Specify persona, tone, output format, success criteria, examples        |
| **Adaptive**   | Offer alternative approaches  | Provide variations, alternative structures, temperature suggestions     |
| **Reflective** | Encourage validation          | Add checklists, edge cases, fact-checking steps, risk mitigation        |

## How Clavix uses CLEAR

- `clavix fast` scores Concise, Logical, and Explicit, producing a single improved prompt and a list of labeled changes.
- `clavix deep` unlocks Adaptive and Reflective components, delivering alternative phrasings, structures, and validation checklists.
- `clavix prd` validates generated quick PRDs for the C/L/E components unless validation is explicitly skipped.
- `clavix summarize` can optionally re-run CLEAR on extracted prompts to give you an optimized variant ready for AI agents.
