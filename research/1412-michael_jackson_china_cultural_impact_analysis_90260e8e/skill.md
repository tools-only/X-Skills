## 1. Historical Context: China's Reform Era

### 1.1 The Opening-Up Period (1978-1989)

Michael Jackson's rise coincided precisely with China's economic reforms and opening to the West, creating ideal conditions for cultural transmission:

- **Timing:** Jackson's peak popularity (1980s) aligned with China's Reform and Opening-Up policy
- **Media Access:** Hong Kong served as the critical mediator, introducing U.S. pop culture to mainland China
- **Cultural Thirst:** A generation of Chinese youth, hungry for new cultural forms after the Cultural Revolution, embraced Jackson's music

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1080/14649373.2022.2064610

### 1.2 The "Zouxue" (Moonlighting) Economy

An underground commercial dance economy emerged, allowing dancers to perform in informal venues and spread Jackson's choreography:

- Dancers learned and taught Jackson's moves in underground venues
- The "zouxue" economy facilitated cultural transmission before widespread media access
- This informal network created China's first localized hip-hop movement

## 2. Influence on Chinese Pop Music

### 2.1 Revolutionary Sound for Chinese Musicians

Michael Jackson introduced an entirely new sonic palette to Chinese musicians:

> "When China was just opening up Chinese musicians didn't know much about Western music, they didn't know much about rock and roll. His music was very very fresh at the time, very different from anything they had heard of before. And so we started to try something new. And now we can see many pop singers singing like Michael and dancing like Michael."
