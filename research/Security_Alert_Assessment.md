# Security Alert Assessment

This document explains the security scanning alerts that have been assessed
and determined to be false positives or intentionally suppressed.

## DS162092 - Hardcoded URLs

**Status:** Excluded in DevSkim workflow via `exclude-rules`

### Explanation

This rule is excluded because this research tool legitimately integrates with
external APIs. All hardcoded URLs are intentional service endpoints:

- **ArXiv** - Academic paper repository (`https://arxiv.org/`)
- **PubMed** - Medical literature database
- **Semantic Scholar** - AI-powered research tool
- **OpenAlex** - Open catalog of scholarly works
- **Archive.org** - Wayback Machine integration

### Why Exclusion Is Safe

1. **Legitimate API endpoints** - URLs are for real research services
2. **SSRF protection** - Production code uses
   `src/local_deep_research/security/ssrf_validator.py` to block dangerous URLs
3. **No user-controlled URLs** - All URLs are hardcoded service endpoints
4. **Test coverage** - URL handling is tested in `tests/fuzz/test_security_fuzzing.py`

## DS137138 - Hardcoded Credentials

**Status:** Excluded via workflow configuration (no action needed)

### Explanation

All ~100+ hardcoded credential alerts are in the `tests/` directory and are
intentional mock data for testing.

### Why They Are Safe

1. **All instances are test fixtures** - Named clearly as mock data:
   - `api_key="test_key"`
   - `password="testpass"`
   - `sample_data_with_secrets()`

2. **DevSkim already excludes tests** - The `.github/workflows/devskim.yml`
   configuration includes:
   ```yaml
   ignore-globs: 'examples/**,tests/**'
   ```

3. **Never real credentials** - All test values are obviously fake

4. **Gitleaks handles real secrets** - The `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml`
   workflow scans for actual leaked credentials

### Example Test Fixtures

- `tests/fixtures/mock_credentials.py`
- `tests/unit/auth/test_login.py`
- `tests/integration/api/test_authentication.py`

## DS172411 - JavaScript DOM (innerHTML)

**Status:** Addressed with XSS protection infrastructure

### Explanation

The codebase has comprehensive XSS protection infrastructure in
`src/local_deep_research/web/static/js/security/xss-protection.js`:

| Protection Function | Purpose |
|---------------------|---------|
| `escapeHtml()` | HTML entity escaping for text content |
| `sanitizeHtml()` | DOMPurify-based HTML sanitization |
| `safeSetInnerHTML()` | Safe innerHTML wrapper |
| `sanitizeUserInput()` | User input validation and sanitization |

### Current Status

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Using `escapeHtml()` | ~35 | Safe |
| Using `textContent` | ~20 | Safe |
| Static HTML only | ~15 | Safe |
| Using `sanitizeHtml()` | ~5 | Safe |

All innerHTML usages have been reviewed and appropriate sanitization applied.

## DS176209 - Suspicious Comments

**Status:** Excluded in DevSkim workflow via `exclude-rules`

### Explanation

DevSkim flags comments containing words like `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `BUG`,
`XXX` as "suspicious". These are **standard development annotations** used
to track technical debt and future work.

### Why Exclusion Is Safe

1. **Not a security rule** - This is a code quality check, not security
2. **Standard practice** - TODO/FIXME comments are used in every codebase
3. **No runtime impact** - Comments have no effect on application behavior
4. **IDE support** - Development tools already track these annotations

## Container Image CVEs

**Status:** Documented, awaiting upstream fixes

### No Fix Available

The following CVEs are in the Debian base image packages with no upstream
fixes currently available:

| CVE | Package | Severity | Notes |
|-----|---------|----------|-------|
| CVE-2025-14104 | util-linux | Medium | No fix version |
| CVE-2022-0563 | util-linux | Low | Debian won't fix |
| CVE-2025-6141 | Various | Low | No fix version |

These are monitored and will be addressed when fixes become available.

## DevSkim Rule Exclusions Summary

The following rules are excluded in `.github/workflows/devskim.yml`:

| Rule | Name | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| DS162092 | Hardcoded URL | Legitimate API endpoints for research services |
| DS176209 | Suspicious Comment | Standard TODO/FIXME annotations |

### Review Cadence

These exclusions should be reviewed **quarterly** to ensure:
- No new security-relevant URLs are being masked
- Exclusions remain appropriate as the codebase evolves
- New DevSkim rules are evaluated for applicability

**Last reviewed:** December 2025
