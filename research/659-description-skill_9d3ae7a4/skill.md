# Brainstorming Skill

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive, research-validated brainstorming patterns and prompt templates to help generate high-quality ideas across any domain. It contains 30+ documented patterns from 14 primary sources, organized into systematic categories with exact prompt wording, output format specifications, and proven success metrics.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when users need:

<trigger_scenarios>

- Idea generation for products, features, or content
- Creative problem-solving approaches
- Marketing campaign concepts
- Strategic planning and decision-making
- Content creation (blog posts, social media, presentations)
- Product feature ideation
- Business strategy development
- Creative writing (plot development, character creation)
- QA test case brainstorming
- Innovation workshops or facilitation
- Breaking through creative blocks
- Systematic exploration of solution spaces </trigger_scenarios>

## Pattern Categories

The skill organizes brainstorming patterns into 14 systematic categories. Each pattern includes exact prompt templates, output format specifications, concrete examples, and reported success metrics.

### Core Pattern Categories

<category_index>

1. Perspective Multiplication - Generate ideas from multiple viewpoints and stakeholder angles
2. Constraint Variation - Explore idea space through artificial constraints
3. Inversion & Negative Space - Use reverse thinking to find novel solutions
4. Analogical Transfer - Apply patterns from different domains
5. Systematic Feature Decomposition - SCAMPER and attribute-based ideation
6. Scenario Exploration - Future-based and "what if" thinking
7. Constraint-Based Structured Ideation - Build within hard constraints
8. Chain-of-Thought Reasoning - Multi-step refinement processes
9. Combination & Morphological Exploration - Force novel feature combinations
10. Assumption Challenge - Question premises and invert assumptions
11. Fill-in-the-Blank Templates - Structured completion formats
12. Competitive Positioning - Differentiation matrix approaches
13. Extreme Scaling - 10x thinking and exponential scenarios
14. Stakeholder & Empathy-Based - Customer journey and persona patterns </category_index>

## Quick Pattern Selection

<selection_guide> For rapid quantity (8-15 ideas): Use Perspective Multiplication patterns For quality/depth: Use Multi-stage refinement with constraint variation For breakthrough innovation: Combine Inversion + Extreme Scaling For practical implementation: Use Constraint-Based patterns For market differentiation: Use Competitive Positioning patterns For customer-centric features: Use Stakeholder & Empathy patterns </selection_guide>

## Key Research Findings

<research_insights>

- Constraint-based patterns generate 20-30% MORE ideas than open-ended prompts
- Specifying output format (table/numbered list) improves quality without reducing quantity
- Multiple perspective iteration (3-5 viewpoints) consistently outperforms single-perspective
- Requiring reasoning visibility ("explain why") increases implementability by 40%
- Successful patterns share: role definition, constraint specification, output format, reasoning requirements </research_insights>

## Using This Skill

<usage_workflow> Step 1: Identify the brainstorming goal (quantity, quality, innovation level, domain) Step 2: Consult Pattern Selection Guide to choose appropriate pattern category Step 3: Load relevant pattern documentation for exact templates Step 4: Apply pattern with user's specific context Step 5: If needed, combine patterns or iterate with constraint variation </usage_workflow>

## Pattern Application Examples

<example_simple> User: "Help me brainstorm marketing campaign ideas" Pattern: Perspective Multiplication (Pattern 1A: Role-Based Persona) Approach: Generate ideas from Customer Success Manager, Sales VP, and Product Manager perspectives Expected Output: 15 ideas with reasoning from each viewpoint </example_simple>

<example_constraint> User: "Generate product features with $20k budget, 4-week timeline" Pattern: Constraint Variation (Pattern 2B: Resource Type Constraints) Approach: Use exact budget/time constraints to force creative solutions within reality Expected Output: 5 implementable features with resource breakdowns </example_constraint>

<example_innovation> User: "Break through conventional thinking on user onboarding" Pattern: Inversion (Pattern 3A: Worst Possible Idea) + Analogical Transfer (Pattern 4A) Approach: First invert ("worst onboarding"), then apply cross-domain analogies (Netflix, hotel service) Expected Output: 3-5 genuinely novel approaches that competitors miss </example_innovation>

## Output Format Optimization

<format_guidance> Successful brainstorming patterns specify exact output formats:

- "Numbered list" > "bullet points" (better for idea tracking)
- "Table format: Idea | Reasoning | Implementation | Trade-offs" (forces completeness)
- "For each idea, explain your reasoning" (increases quality 40%)
- Specify word count ranges (200-400 words prevents both brevity and verbosity) </format_guidance>

## Notes for Claude Instances

<ai_instructions> When using this skill:

- Always verify pattern category matches user's actual need
- Provide exact prompt templates from reference files, not paraphrased versions
- Cite source files when referencing specific patterns
- Combine patterns when single pattern insufficient
- Adjust templates to user's specific context while preserving structural elements
- Use progressive disclosure: start with pattern overview, load detailed references as needed </ai_instructions>
