Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases

Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (1974)

Abstract

People rely on a limited set of heuristics to judge probabilities and values under uncertainty. These heuristics—representativeness, availability, and anchoring/adjustment—are efficient but induce systematic, predictable biases. Empirical demonstrations include base-rate neglect, insensitivity to sample size, misconceptions of chance, illusory correlation, and overconfidence.

1. Introduction

Human judgment often operates under limited information and computational constraints. Rather than normative Bayesian integration, people deploy fast heuristics. The paper enumerates principal heuristics, documents recurrent error patterns, and examines conditions under which judgments deviate from probability theory and statistical logic.

2. Representativeness

Representativeness evaluates probability by similarity to a prototype, eclipsing base rates, predictive validity, and sample size.

2.1 Insensitivity to Prior Probabilities (Base-Rate Neglect)

- Engineer–lawyer vignette: Given personality sketches diagnostically weak but “stereotypical,” subjects judged category membership primarily by representativeness, largely ignoring stated base rates.

- Disease testing and “taxi cab” problems illustrate substitution of resemblance for likelihood.

  2.2 Insensitivity to Sample Size

- Hospital births: People expect similar rates of “>60% boys in a day” in small and large hospitals, disregarding higher variance in smaller samples.

- Consequence: Overinterpretation of small‑n outcomes; underestimation of variance constraints.

  2.3 Misconceptions of Chance

- Random sequences are expected to appear locally random (too many alternations, too few runs).

- Gambler’s fallacy: Expectation of self‑correction after streaks (e.g., excess heads followed by tails).

- Conflation of fairness (process) with representativeness (pattern).

  2.4 Insensitivity to Predictive Validity

- Overreliance on “diagnostic” features even when predictive validity is low or measured on noisy criteria; neglect of reliability and criterion distributions.

  2.5 The “Conjunction Fallacy”

- Linda problem archetype: P(A ∧ B) judged more probable than P(A) when B adds representational fit, despite logical impossibility.

3. Availability

Availability estimates frequency or probability by ease of recall or construction.

3.1 Retrievability of Instances

- Famous names study: Lists with famous members bias judgments of which gender is more numerous.

- Recent, vivid, or salient events inflate perceived frequency (e.g., accidents after seeing a crash).

  3.2 Effectiveness of Search Set

- Words with “R” as first vs. third letter: Easier retrieval of initial position leads to systematic overestimation.

- Category structure modulates search fluency, distorting frequency judgments.

  3.3 Biases of Imaginability

- Frequency assessed by ease of generative enumeration: Smaller committees (easier to imagine) overestimated relative to larger ones.

- Scenario availability skews risk perception and planning.

  3.4 Illusory Correlation

- Perceived association between distinctive co‑occurrences (e.g., trait–diagnosis pairs) persists despite weak or absent statistical covariation.

4. Anchoring and Adjustment

Judgments start from an initial value (anchor) and adjust insufficiently.

4.1 Insufficient Adjustment

- Wheel‑of‑fortune UN‑Africa percentages: Arbitrary anchors (10 vs. 65) shift final estimates markedly.

- Multiplication sequence estimate: Starting with 8×7×… vs. 1×2×… produces higher vs. lower partial products and biased global estimates.

  4.2 Conjunctive and Disjunctive Events

- Conjunctive (all must occur) probabilities overestimated; disjunctive (any may occur) underestimated.

- Planning fallacy: Overoptimistic timelines (conjunctive chains).

- Underestimation of system failure from multiple weak links (disjunctive risks).

  4.3 Overconfidence and Narrow Intervals

- Subjective confidence intervals are too narrow; 98% intervals cover true values far less often than stated.

- Anchoring on best estimates plus insufficient outward adjustment yields undercalibration.

5. Additional Biases and Effects

5.1 Regression to the Mean

- Failure to anticipate regression yields spurious causal attributions (e.g., “punishment works” after an extreme bad performance regresses upward).

  5.2 Illusion of Control

- Perceived control over chance tasks increases with involvement, choice, or skill cues (e.g., rolling dice harder for high numbers).

  5.3 Hindsight Bias

- After outcomes are known, probabilities are judged as having been higher; “knew‑it‑all‑along” distortion impairs learning from surprise.

6. Normative Conflicts and Theoretical Considerations

Heuristics trade computational economy for systematic bias. Deviations from Bayes, sampling theory, and logic arise from:

- Substitution of similarity for likelihood.

- Fluency‑driven frequency estimation.

- Insufficient adjustment from arbitrary or informative anchors.

The authors argue for descriptive adequacy over prescriptive optimality in naturalistic judgment and propose bounded rationality as design space for cognitive strategies.

7. Methodological Notes

Experiments employ:

- Vignette‑based probability judgments with controlled base rates and validity.

- Frequency estimation tasks manipulating retrieval fluency.

- Anchoring via arbitrary numbers or computation order.

- Confidence interval elicitation and calibration scoring.

Findings replicate across student and expert samples, with robust effect sizes and cross‑task consistency.

8. Practical Implications

- Decision analysis: Explicit base rates and reliability metrics should be foregrounded.

- Forecasting: Use calibration training; widen intervals; stress external validity.

- Policy and risk: Prefer large‑n evidence; counteract salience with statistical priors.

- Organizational planning: Debias conjunctive chain estimates; employ reference class forecasting.

9. Limitations and Boundary Conditions

- Heuristics are adaptive under ecological constraints; bias magnitude varies with representational format, training, incentives, and feedback.

- Expertise attenuates some errors but does not eliminate anchoring or availability effects.

- Task structure (natural frequencies, visualizations) can reduce base‑rate neglect.

10. Conclusion

Representativeness, availability, and anchoring/adjustment structure human judgment under uncertainty. Their efficiency entails predictable departures from normative models—base‑rate neglect, sampling insensitivity, chance misconceptions, illusory correlation, and overconfidence. Designing environments and tools that expose priors, sample size, and variance—and that disrupt anchoring and salience—can systematically improve inference.
