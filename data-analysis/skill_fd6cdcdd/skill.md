# Book Installer

## Overview

This meta-skill handles installation and setup tasks for intelligent textbook projects. It consolidates three installation skills into a single entry point with on-demand loading of specific installation guides.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users request:

- Setting up a new MkDocs Material project
- Creating a new intelligent textbook from scratch
- Installing a learning graph viewer
- Setting up skill usage tracking with hooks
- Bootstrapping project infrastructure

## Step 1: Handle Help Requests

If the user asks for "help", "what can you do", or "list features", display this numbered list directly (do not load a reference file):

```

20. Blog support - Add blog section
21. Announcement bar - Dismissible top banner
22. Privacy & cookie consent - GDPR compliance
23. Learning graph viewer - Interactive concept visualization
24. Skill usage tracker - Claude Code analytics hooks
25. Google Analytics - requires a Google Analytics property ID G-*
26. .gitignore installer - make sure that `site` and `.cache` are not in the main branch
27. extra CSS installer for iframe and customer prompt admonition
28. extra JavaScript installer - for prompt admonition copy button
29. Feature checklist - auto-detect and document which features are implemented

Type a number or feature name to install.

Note: If you see `navigation.tabs` in mkdocs.yml, remove it. These books
use side navigation optimized for wide landscape screens.
```

After displaying the list, wait for user to specify which feature they want.

---

## Step 1b: Check for Navigation Tabs (Existing Projects)

When working with an existing mkdocs.yml, always check for and remove navigation tabs:

```yaml
# REMOVE these lines if present in mkdocs.yml:
theme:
  features:
    - navigation.tabs        # DELETE
    - navigation.tabs.sticky # DELETE
```

These books use side navigation optimized for wide landscape screens. Top navigation tabs waste vertical space and are not appropriate for this format.
