# Effective Prompts for Documentation Generation

**Purpose**: Learn how to use GitHub Copilot to generate professional documentation in minutes instead of hours.  
**Time Savings**: 90% reduction (20 hours → 2 hours)  
**Use Cases**: Architecture docs, runbooks, troubleshooting guides, API documentation

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Be Specific About Output Format

❌ **Vague**: "Generate documentation"  
✅ **Specific**: "Generate a Markdown architecture document with Mermaid diagrams, resource inventory table, and cost analysis section"

### 2. Provide Context

❌ **No Context**: "Document these Azure resources"  
✅ **With Context**: "Generate operational runbook for production e-commerce infrastructure deployed via Bicep, including deployment steps, scaling procedures, and rollback instructions"

### 3. Specify Structure

❌ **Unstructured**: "Make docs"  
✅ **Structured**: "Create documentation with these sections: Overview, Prerequisites, Architecture, Deployment Steps, Validation Checklist, Troubleshooting, References"

### 4. Use Templates

❌ **Ad-hoc**: Generate from scratch every time  
✅ **Template-based**: "Use this template structure: [paste template], fill with Azure Resource Graph data for resource group rg-prod"

## Pattern 6: Generating Diagrams

### Architecture Diagrams (Mermaid)

**Prompt**:

```bicep
Generate Mermaid architecture diagram for Azure infrastructure.

Resources:
[paste resource list or describe infrastructure]

Diagram requirements:
- Use `graph TB` (top-to-bottom layout)
- Group resources by tier: `subgraph Frontend`, `subgraph Application`, `subgraph Data`
- Show resource relationships with labeled arrows
- Use Azure service types as node labels
- Include external dependencies (on-prem, third-party APIs)

Relationships to show:
- Application → Database (connections)
- Application → Storage (data access)
- Frontend → Application (API calls)
- All → Monitoring (telemetry)

Output: Valid Mermaid syntax in Markdown code block
```

**Example Output**:

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'neutral'}}%%
graph TB
    subgraph Frontend
        AGW[Application Gateway]
        CDN[Azure CDN]
    end
    subgraph Application
        AppSvc[App Service]
        Functions[Azure Functions]
    end
    subgraph Data
        SQL[(SQL Database)]
        Cosmos[(Cosmos DB)]
        Blob[Blob Storage]
    end
    
    CDN -->|static content| AppSvc
    AGW -->|HTTPS| AppSvc
    AppSvc -->|queries| SQL
    AppSvc -->|reads/writes| Blob
    Functions -->|writes| Cosmos
```

### Network Topology Diagrams

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: Iterative Refinement

**Step 1 - Generate Basic Version**:

```

Generate basic architecture documentation for [resource group].
Include resource inventory and simple diagram.

```

**Step 2 - Enhance Specific Section**:

```

Expand the network security section of the architecture document.
Add details on:

- NSG rules and their purposes
- Azure Firewall configuration
- DDoS protection
- Private endpoints
- Service endpoints

```

**Step 3 - Add Cross-References**:

```

Add cross-references throughout the document:

- Link troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Reference runbook for operational procedures
- Link to compliance documentation
- Add related Azure documentation links

```

**Step 4 - Customize Tone**:

```

Adjust document tone for [audience]:

- Executive summary: Business-focused, non-technical
- Technical sections: Detailed for operations team
- Appendix: Reference information for support staff

```

### Technique 2: Template-Based Generation

**Create Template Once**:

```markdown

## Executive Summary
[AUTO: Service overview, resource count, cost estimate]

## Architecture Overview
[AUTO: High-level description]

### Architecture Diagram
[AUTO: Mermaid diagram]

## Resource Inventory
[AUTO: Table of resources]

## [Continue with your standard sections...]
```

**Prompt for Each Project**:

```bicep
Fill this architecture template for resource group [name]:
[paste template]

Extract data from Azure Resource Graph.
Generate Mermaid diagrams automatically.
Calculate cost estimates from resource SKUs.
```

### Technique 3: Multi-Document Generation

**Prompt for Complete Documentation Suite**:

```bicep
Generate complete documentation suite for [project name]:

1. Architecture Documentation (architecture.md)
   - Resource inventory, diagrams, security, costs
2. Deployment Runbook (deployment.md)
   - From Bicep templates at [path]
3. Operations Runbook (operations.md)
   - Daily, weekly, monthly procedures
4. Troubleshooting Guide (troubleshooting.md)
   - From Application Insights data
5. API Documentation (api.md)
   - From code at [path]
6. DR Procedures (disaster-recovery.md)
   - From backup/replication config

All documents should:
- Use consistent formatting and terminology
- Cross-reference each other
- Include generated date and version
- Use Mermaid for all diagrams

Output: 6 separate Markdown files
```

## Measuring Success

### Documentation Quality Metrics

**Completeness**:

```text
Generate documentation completeness checklist for [doc type].
List all required sections, verify each is present and adequate.
Report completeness percentage.
```

**Accuracy Validation**:

```text
Compare generated documentation against actual Azure resources.
Verify:
- All resources documented
- No phantom resources (documented but don't exist)
- Properties match reality (SKUs, locations, configurations)
- Diagrams accurately represent relationships
Report discrepancies for manual review.
```

### Time Savings Tracking

| Document Type | Manual Time | Copilot Time | Savings | Savings % |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| Architecture (15 pages) | 6 hours | 20 minutes | 5h 40m | 95% |
| Runbook (25 pages) | 5 hours | 20 minutes | 4h 40m | 93% |
| Troubleshooting (20 pages) | 4 hours | 30 minutes | 3h 30m | 87.5% |
| API Docs (18 pages) | 3 hours | 30 minutes | 2h 30m | 83% |
| DR Procedures (12 pages) | 2 hours | 20 minutes | 1h 40m | 83% |
| **TOTAL (90 pages)** | **20 hours** | **2 hours** | **18 hours** | **90%** |

## Troubleshooting Copilot

### Issue: Generated Content Too Generic

**Problem**: Documentation lacks specific details  
**Solution**: Provide more context in prompt

```yaml
# Instead of:
"Generate architecture documentation"

# Use:
"Generate architecture documentation for e-commerce platform on Azure.
Environment: Production
Scale: 10,000 concurrent users
Critical components: Payment processing, inventory management, order fulfillment
Compliance: PCI DSS, GDPR
Include specific configuration details for each component."
```

### Issue: Diagram Syntax Errors

**Problem**: Mermaid diagram won't render  
**Solution**: Request validation and fix

```text
Generate Mermaid architecture diagram for [resources].
After generation, validate Mermaid syntax is correct.
Fix any syntax errors.
Test in Mermaid Live Editor.
```

### Issue: Outdated Information

**Problem**: Documentation references old Azure Portal or deprecated features  
**Solution**: Specify current best practices

```text
Generate documentation using current Azure best practices (2024).
Use:
- Azure CLI (latest version)
- Bicep (not ARM templates)
- Managed identities (not service principals where possible)
- Private endpoints (not service endpoints)
- Azure Monitor (not classic alerts)
```

### Issue: Inconsistent Formatting

**Problem**: Multiple documents have different styles  
**Solution**: Use consistent template

```javascript
Generate all documents using this template structure:
[paste template with heading styles, section order, formatting rules]

Ensure consistency:
- Heading hierarchy (# ## ###)
- Code block language tags (```powershell, ```json)
- Table formatting
- Bullet vs numbered lists (bullets for items, numbers for steps)
```

---

## Best Practices Summary

### DO

✅ Provide detailed context about your infrastructure  
✅ Specify exact output format (Markdown, sections, diagrams)  
✅ Use templates for consistency across projects  
✅ Iterate and refine (basic → detailed → polished)  
✅ Verify generated content against reality  
✅ Customize for your audience (executives vs. operations)  
✅ Version control documentation alongside code  
✅ Regenerate when infrastructure changes  

### DON'T

❌ Use vague prompts ("make docs")  
❌ Skip human review and customization  
❌ Treat generated docs as 100% accurate without validation  
❌ Forget to update documentation when infrastructure changes  
❌ Store only in Word/Visio (use version-controlled Markdown)  
❌ Generate once and forget (docs should be living)
