# Structured Outputs

Get provider‑enforced typed results in ~6 minutes. Requires Python 3.10+ and `pip install alloy-ai`.

---

Alloy enforces outputs using provider structured outputs. A JSON Schema is sent to the model, and responses are parsed into your requested type.

## How it works (strict mode)

- Primitives (str, int, float, bool):
  - Providers require an object root. Alloy wraps primitives as `{ "value": <primitive> }` and unwraps `value` before parsing.
- Dataclasses & TypedDict (objects):
  - A JSON Schema is generated from the type. In strict mode, all fields are required and `additionalProperties: false` is set.
- Arrays: `list[T]` is supported when `T` maps to a concrete schema as above.

There is no prompt shaping. Output shape is enforced only via structured outputs.

## Return Contracts

- Default `@command`: returns `str`. If the model produces no final output, Alloy raises `CommandError`.
- `@command(output=None)`: side-effect only. The wrapper always returns `None`.
- `@command(output=T)`: strict typed return. Returns `T` or raises on empty/mismatch.

Authoring guideline: the decorated function always returns a prompt `str`. The actual return type of the command is controlled by the decorator’s `output` parameter.

## Strict-mode limitations

Some types cannot produce a strict JSON Schema under provider constraints:

- Open-ended objects (`dict` or `dict[...]`) and `list[dict]` are not supported.
  - Strict mode requires `additionalProperties: false`. Accepting arbitrary keys would violate this, so Alloy raises a clear configuration error.
- Optional/Union types are not supported yet.

Use a concrete schema instead, such as a `@dataclass` or `TypedDict` with known fields.

## Errors and diagnostics

- If an unsupported output type is used in strict mode, Alloy raises `ConfigurationError` with guidance to use a concrete schema.
- If the model returns an unparsable payload or no final output, Alloy raises `CommandError` with the expected type and a snippet of the model output.

Example parse error:

```
CommandError: Failed to parse model output as float: 'Please provide the text…'
```

## Example

```python
from alloy import command

@command(output=float)
def extract_price(text: str) -> str:
    return f"Extract the price (number only) from: {text}"

print(extract_price("This item costs $49.99."))  # -> 49.99
```

## Provider notes

- OpenAI: Uses Responses `text={"format": {"type": "json_schema", ...}}` and unwraps primitives from `{"value": ...}`. When tool calls complete but no final structured output is present, Alloy can optionally issue one follow‑up turn (no tools) using the same schema to request the final answer. This is controlled by `auto_finalize_missing_output` (env `ALLOY_AUTO_FINALIZE_MISSING_OUTPUT`, default on). If disabled or still missing, the command raises.
- Anthropic/Gemini: Use their respective structured-output mechanisms with a JSON Schema.
- Ollama: Native `/api/chat` supports strict JSON via `format={JSON Schema}` (Alloy wraps primitives as `{ "value": ... }`). The OpenAI‑compatible Chat Completions path can also produce structured JSON; when tools are used or a final payload is missing, Alloy may perform one follow‑up (no tools) if `auto_finalize_missing_output` is enabled.
- Some providers may require a final follow‑up turn to produce a structured response when tools are used. When `auto_finalize_missing_output` is enabled (default), Alloy performs a single follow‑up turn without tools to request the final structured answer.
