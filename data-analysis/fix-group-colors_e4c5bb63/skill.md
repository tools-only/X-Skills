# Fix Group Colors

I would like a to make sure that whenever we generate a learning graph that we use
the following web-safe color names to color the groups in a learning graph.

Please modify the program @skills/learning-graph-generator/csv-to-json.py to always
use these ans the named colors in the groups section of the JASON file.
Update the skill to never use HEX colors in the groups section of the JSON file.
These are the default-colors:

1. MistyRose
2. PeachPuff
3. LightYellow
4. Honeydew
5. PaleTurquoise
6. AliceBlue
7. Lavender
8. LavenderBlush
9. BlanchedAlmond
10. MintCream
11. LightCoral
12. Plum
13. Gainsboro
