This interactive visualization compares poor (linear chain) and good (networked) learning graph structures side-by-side.

## Interactive Diagram



## Overview

The comparison demonstrates:
- **Linear chain:** Single rigid path with no flexibility (poor design)
- **Network structure:** Multiple pathways with cross-connections (good design)

Includes a detailed comparison table explaining why network structures are superior for learning graphs.
