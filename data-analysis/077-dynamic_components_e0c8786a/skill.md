# Dynamic Components

These fully AI/LLM selected and configured dynamic *Data UI Blocks* are supported by *UI Agent*. UI Agent selects UI 
component which matches best the current user prompt and [input data structure](../input_data/structure.md).
*UI Agent* selects from all the supported components by default, but you can narrow choice to the components suitable for your application
[in the configuration](../configuration.md#selectable_components-setstr-optional).

Optionally, this components can be [mapped per `InputData.type` and optionally pre-configured in this mapping](../configuration.md#components-listagentconfigcomponent-optional).

See details about [component selection and configuration process](index.md#selection-and-configuration-process).

Examples of the Patternfly React renderings are also availablein the [renderer demo](https://redhat-ux.github.io/next-gen-ui-react/).

## Components for [one `Object` input data](../input_data/structure.md#one-object-input-data)

### Card

Component identification: [`one-card`](../../spec/component.md#one-card)

Card is UI block that displays:

  * Title
  * Facts list
  * Image (if [image url is present in the input data](../input_data/structure.md#image-url) and selected to be shown)

Facts are name-value pairs, where the `name` is AI generated and the `value` is gathered from agent's input data.
Value can be simple text or number etc. List (array) of values is supported as well.

Example rendering by Red Hat Design System for user prompt `Tell me details about Toy Story`:

### Image

Component identification: [`image`](../../spec/component.md#image)

Image is UI block to display a single image with a title, based on [image url present in the input data](../input_data/structure.md#image-url).

Example rendering by Red Hat Design System for a prompt `Show me poster of Toy Story movie`:

![Image Data UI Block rendering by Red Hat Design System](../../img/data_ui_block_image.png "Image Data UI Block rendering by Red Hat Design System")

Image is found by agent from backend-data either by field value or by field name. See the [spec/component/image.schema.json](https://github.com/RedHat-UX/next-gen-ui-agent/blob/main/spec/component/image.schema.json) for more details.

### Video Player

Component identification: [`video-player`](../../spec/component.md#video-player)

Video player is UI block to play a single video from [video URL provided in the input data](../input_data/structure.md#video-url).

Title is also generated, and link pointing to the video cover image for YouTube videos is provided.

!!!warning
    Ability to play videos from video service url's (YouTube, Vimeo) or support for video file 
    formats (`avi`, `mpeg`, `mov`, ...) can vary in individual [UI renderers](../renderer/index.md)!

Example rendering by Red Hat Design System for a prompt `Play trailer of Toy Story movie`:

## Components for [`Array of objects` input data](../input_data/structure.md#array-of-objects-input-data)

### Set Of Cards

Component identification: [`set-of-cards`](../../spec/component.md#set-of-cards)

Set of Card is UI block that displays:

  * Title
  * Set of multiple Card components, each showing the same list of facts

Facts are name-value pairs, where the `name` is AI generated and the `value` is gathered from agent's input data.
Value can be simple text or number etc. List (array) of values is supported as well.

Layout for this set of cards has to be provided by frontend application.

Example rendering by Patternfly React Cards:

![Set Of Cards Data UI Block rendering by Patternfly React](../../img/data_ui_block_set-of-cards.png "Set Of Cards Data UI Block rendering by Patternfly React")

If enabled in the *UI Agent* configuration, [agent's output can contain list of all fields available in the input data](../../spec/output.md), so you can 
provide user with the ability to manually select what is shown after this UI component is generated.

### Table

Component identification: [`table`](../../spec/component.md#table)

Table is UI block that displays:

  * Title
  * Table with AI selected Columns with AI generated names, and rows of values gathered from agent's input data.

Individual cell value can be simple text or number etc. List (array) of values is supported as well.

Example rendering by Patternfly React Data view:

![Table Data UI Block rendering by Patternfly React](../../img/data_ui_block_table.png "Table Data UI Block rendering by Patternfly React")

If enabled in the *UI Agent* configuration, [agent's output can contain list of all fields available in the input data](../../spec/output.md), so you can 
provide user with the ability to manually select which columns are shown after this UI component is generated.

### Charts

UI Agent can generate chart component with multiple different visualization types, each with own Component identification:

* `chart-bar` - Bar charts for comparing metrics across categories
* `chart-line` - Line charts for trends over time
* `chart-pie` - Pie charts for showing proportions
* `chart-donut` - Donut charts for showing proportions with a central metric
* `chart-mirrored-bar` - Mirrored bar charts for comparing two metrics side-by-side

Chart is UI block that displays:

  * Title
  * Data with one or multiple named *data series*, containing array of *data points*.

Individual chart types share the same [UI component configuration format](../../spec/component.md#chart), but exact 
requirements on the data differ a bit. Shapes of the data and mapping from the *UI Agent* input data is [described here](../input_data/charts.md).

Example rendering of Pie Chart by Patternfly React:

![Pie Chart Data UI Block rendering by Patternfly React](../../img/data_ui_block_chart-pie.png "Pie Chart Data UI Block rendering by Patternfly React")

More chart examples are available in the [Patternfly React renderer demo](https://redhat-ux.github.io/next-gen-ui-react/component/chart).
