## Introduction

The workflow command system provides a structured approach to managing software development epics from initial research through completion and retrospective analysis. Each command in the system produces outputs that feed into subsequent commands, creating a traceable chain of documentation and decisions.

**Key Benefits:**
- Consistent documentation across all epics
- Traceable decisions from discovery through implementation
- Automated status updates in Jira
- Centralized knowledge in Confluence
- Built-in quality gates through mandatory checkpoints

---

## Intake Phase (Pre-Workflow)

> **Status:** Planned — these commands are not yet implemented.

The Intake phase runs once per project to document the existing codebase. See [Intake Phase Overview](workflow/intake-phase.md) for details.

| Command | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `intake:document-codebase` | Generate codebase documentation | Planned |
| `intake:capture-behavior` | Capture existing system behavior | Planned |
| `intake:create-system-description` | Create system description | Planned |

---

## Full Lifecycle Overview

The complete workflow spans four distinct phases, each with specialized commands that produce artifacts consumed by downstream phases.

| Sprint Retrospectives | `/Retrospectives/Sprint [N]/` |

**Document Lifecycle:**
1. Created in `/In Progress/` during planning
2. Updated throughout execution
3. Moved to `/Complete/Sprint [N]/` on epic completion
4. Referenced in sprint retrospectives

---

## Checkpoint System

Every command includes mandatory user approval gates to ensure human oversight at critical decision points.

### Checkpoint Philosophy

Checkpoints serve to:
- Prevent unintended changes to Jira or Confluence
- Ensure alignment on approach before work begins
- Provide opportunities to correct course
- Maintain audit trail of decisions

### Checkpoint Types

**Confirmation Checkpoints:**
Verify information before proceeding.
```
Please confirm before I proceed:

Epic Key: CC-123
Epic Title: User Authentication
Linked Tickets: 8 tickets found
Publish Location: /Epics/In Progress/CC-123/

Is this correct? (Yes / No / Correct)
```

**Approval Checkpoints:**
Require explicit approval before making changes.
```
Ready to publish this planning document to Confluence? (Yes / No / Modify)
```

**Decision Checkpoints:**
Present options when issues are encountered.
```
Epic CC-123 has incomplete tickets:

In Progress:
- CC-124: User login form - Status: In Progress

Options:
A) Complete remaining tickets first
B) Move incomplete tickets to backlog and close epic
C) Extend epic deadline and keep open

What would you like to do? [A/B/C]
```

### Checkpoints by Command

| Command | Checkpoints |
|---------|-------------|
| `discovery:create` | Epic confirmation, Document review before publish |
| `discovery:synthesize` | Sources confirmation, Synthesis review before publish |
| `discovery:approve` | Decision resolution, Ticket modifications, Ticket creation approval |
| `planning:epic-plan` | Epic confirmation, Document review before publish |
| `planning:impl-plan` | Document confirmation, Ticket changes, Plan preview, Overview updates |
| `execution:execute-ticket` | Ticket selection, Deviation approval, Completion review |
| `execution:complete-ticket` | Finalization confirmation |
| `retrospectives:complete-epic` | Completion readiness, Documentation updates, Epic closure |

### Checkpoint Responses

| Response | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Yes** | Proceed with the proposed action |
| **No** | Stop and ask what changes are needed |
| **Modify** | User provides feedback, regenerate and re-confirm |
| **Correct** | User provides corrections, update and re-confirm |

**Critical Rule:** Commands must never modify Jira or Confluence without explicit user approval at the appropriate checkpoint.

## Utility Commands

### Common Ground

Available at any phase. Surfaces and validates Claude's hidden assumptions about the project.

See [Common Ground Guide](COMMON_GROUND.md) for full documentation.

---

## Workflow Variations

### Standard Implementation Flow

For epics with clear requirements:
```
planning:epic-plan -> planning:impl-plan -> [execution:execute-ticket + execution:complete-ticket] x N -> retrospectives:complete-epic
```

### Discovery-First Flow

For epics requiring research:
```
discovery:create -> [research] -> discovery:synthesize -> discovery:approve -> planning:epic-plan -> planning:impl-plan -> [execution:execute-ticket + execution:complete-ticket] x N -> retrospectives:complete-epic
```

---

## Best Practices

### Document Linking

Always capture and provide document URLs when outputting command results. Downstream commands depend on these URLs:

- `discovery:create` outputs `{Discovery_Document}` for `discovery:synthesize`
- `discovery:synthesize` outputs `{Synthesis_Document}` for `discovery:approve`
- `planning:epic-plan` outputs `{Overview_Document}` for `planning:impl-plan`
- `planning:impl-plan` outputs `{Implementation_Plan}` referenced in tickets

### Ticket Self-Containment

After `planning:impl-plan`, each ticket should be fully self-contained with:
- All implementation steps
- Complete test code (copy-paste ready)
- File paths and modifications
- Acceptance criteria

This enables `execute-ticket` to work without fetching external documents.

### Parallel Execution

Leverage parallel execution waves for efficiency:
- Group independent tickets in the same wave
- Use specialized agents for different work types
- Coordinate completion before advancing to dependent waves

### Knowledge Capture

Use retrospective phases to capture learnings:
- Document patterns to replicate
- Record anti-patterns to avoid
- Generate actionable improvements
- Update team documentation with new standards
