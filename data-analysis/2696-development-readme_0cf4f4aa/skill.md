# Navigator: Context-Efficient AI Development

## The Problem I Kept Hitting

I was working on a feature in Claude Code. Loaded all my project docs at session start—seemed smart. "Better to have everything available," I thought.

Five exchanges in, Claude started forgetting my recent changes. Six exchanges, it hallucinated a function that didn't exist. Seven exchanges, session died. Context window full.

I checked: **150,000 tokens loaded**. Only used **8,000**.

**I was wasting 94% of my context window on documentation I never needed.**

## The Realization

This wasn't a bug. This was my workflow.

Every AI coding session, same pattern:
- Load everything upfront ("just in case")
- Context fills with irrelevant data
- AI gets overwhelmed
- Session crashes
- Start over
- Repeat

**The default approach—load everything—was the problem.**

## What I Built

Navigator: A framework for loading only what you need, when you need it.

**How it works**:
1. Start with a 2k-token navigator (index of what exists)
2. Navigate to what you need (task docs, system architecture)
3. Load on-demand (3-5k tokens per document)
4. Progressive refinement (fetch metadata, drill down if needed)

**Result**: 150k → 12k tokens. **92% reduction.**

Not estimates. Real data, verified with OpenTelemetry.

## Why It Works

**The principle**: Load what you need, when you need it.

Not "load everything just in case."
Not "better safe than sorry."

Strategic loading beats bulk loading.

## 📊 Session Statistics & Grafana Dashboard (New in v3.1)

Navigator uses **OpenTelemetry** for real-time session metrics with visual dashboards.

### Quick Setup (2 minutes)

**1. Enable metrics**:
```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=prometheus

# Reload shell
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

**2. Start Grafana dashboard** (optional):
```bash
cd .agent/grafana
docker compose up -d
```

Access at **http://localhost:3333** (admin/admin)

### What You Get

**Console metrics** (terminal output):
- ✅ Real token usage (not file-size estimates)
- ✅ Cache hit rates (CLAUDE.md caching performance)
- ✅ Session costs (actual USD spent)
- ✅ Active time tracking

**Grafana dashboard** (visual monitoring):
- ✅ 10-panel dashboard with all metrics
- ✅ Token usage trends (cumulative & rate)
- ✅ Cache hit rate gauge (validates optimization)
- ✅ Cost tracking (USD/hour, total cost)
- ✅ Model distribution (Haiku vs Sonnet)
- ✅ Auto-refresh every 10 seconds

**See**:
- [OpenTelemetry Setup Guide](./sops/integrations/opentelemetry-setup.md)
- [Grafana Dashboard README](./grafana/README.md)

## 🤖 Task Completion Protocol (CRITICAL)

### Autonomous Completion Expected

Navigator projects run in **full autonomy mode**. When task implementation is complete:

✅ **Execute automatically** (no human prompt needed):
1. **Commit changes** with conventional commit message
2. **Archive implementation plan** ("Archive TASK-XX documentation")
3. **Close ticket** in PM tool (if configured)
4. **Create completion marker** (`TASK-XX-complete`)
5. **Suggest compact** for next task

❌ **Don't wait for**:
- "Please commit now"
- "Close the ticket"
- "Update documentation"
- "Create a marker"

### Exception Cases (Ask First)

Only interrupt autonomous flow if:
- Uncommitted files contain secrets (.env, credentials, API keys)
- Multiple unrelated tasks modified (unclear which to close)
- No task context loaded (ambiguous TASK-XX)
- Tests failing or implementation incomplete

### Completion Summary Template

```
✅ TASK-XX Complete

Automated actions:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ Committed: [hash] [message]
✅ Documentation: Implementation plan archived
✅ Ticket: Closed in [PM tool]
✅ Marker: TASK-XX-complete created
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Next: "Clear context and preserve markers" to compact
```

**For detailed protocol**: See [`sops/development/autonomous-completion.md`](#autonomous-completion)

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/alekspetrov/navigator.git
cd navigator

# 2. Create test project
mkdir -p ~/Projects/tmp/nav-test
cd ~/Projects/tmp/nav-test

# 3. Point to local plugin (for testing)
# In Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add file:///Users/aleks.petrov/Projects/startups/navigator
/plugin install navigator
```

### Making Changes

```bash
# 1. Read navigator first
Read .agent/DEVELOPMENT-README.md

# 2. Make changes to plugin files
# - Templates: templates/
# - Commands: .claude/commands/
# - Config: .claude-plugin/marketplace.json

# 3. Test in nav-test project
cd ~/Projects/tmp/nav-test
/nav:init  # or other command you're testing

# 4. Verify changes work
ls .agent/  # Check structure created
cat CLAUDE.md  # Check file generated

# 5. Document changes
/nav:update-doc feature TASK-XX
```

### Release Process

```bash
# 1. Update version in marketplace.json
# - Patch: 1.0.1 (bug fix)
# - Minor: 1.1.0 (new feature)
# - Major: 2.0.0 (breaking change)

# 2. Commit changes
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: description"

# 3. Push to GitHub

## 📊 Token Optimization Strategy

**This repo follows Navigator principles**:

1. **Always load**: `DEVELOPMENT-README.md` (~2k tokens)
2. **Load for current work**: Specific system doc (~3k tokens)
3. **Load if needed**: Specific SOP (~2k tokens)
4. **Never load**: All templates at once (~20k tokens)

**Total**: ~7k tokens vs ~35k (80% savings)
