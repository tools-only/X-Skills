- Target range: 2-8%

### Quality Indicators

**No category exceeds 30%**: Ensures no single taxonomy dominates, preventing curriculum imbalance.

**8 categories represented**: Comprehensive coverage across all concept types from foundational to advanced.

**Top 3 categories = 59%**: BASIC, ARCH, and IMPL represent the core curriculum focus while maintaining breadth.

## Analysis

**Balanced Distribution:** The largest category (BASIC at 21%) is within healthy range, ensuring no single taxonomy dominates the learning graph.

**Comprehensive Coverage:** All 8 taxonomy categories are represented, providing diverse learning pathways through foundational, intermediate, and advanced concepts.

**Appropriate Specialization:** Advanced concepts comprise 2.5% of the graph, suggesting appropriate depth without overwhelming learners.

**Quality Assessment:** The top 3 categories (BASIC, ARCH, IMPL) represent 59% of concepts, indicating strong focus on core curriculum while maintaining breadth.

### Healthy Distribution Characteristics

- **Gradual progression**: Higher percentages for basic/intermediate, lower for advanced
- **No gaps**: All taxonomy categories have at least some concepts
- **Balanced core**: Top 3 categories represent 50-70% of total
- **Limited dominance**: No single category exceeds 30%
- **Appropriate specialization**: Advanced categories comprise 5-15% combined

## Customization Guide

### Adding Your Own Data

Replace the data arrays in `main.html` with your taxonomy distribution:

```javascript
const data = {
    labels: [
        'FOUND: 18 concepts (9%)',    // Update with your data
        'BASIC: 42 concepts (21%)',
        'ARCH: 38 concepts (19%)',
        'IMPL: 35 concepts (17.5%)',
        'DATA: 28 concepts (14%)',
        'TOOL: 22 concepts (11%)',
        'QUAL: 12 concepts (6%)',
        'ADV: 5 concepts (2.5%)'
    ],
    datasets: [{
        data: [18, 42, 38, 35, 28, 22, 12, 5],  // Update counts
        // ... colors remain the same
    }]
};
```

### Calculating Distribution from Learning Graph

Use this Python code to generate taxonomy distribution:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load learning graph
df = pd.read_csv('learning-graph.csv')

# Count concepts by taxonomy
taxonomy_counts = df['TaxonomyID'].value_counts().sort_index()

# Calculate percentages
total_concepts = len(df)
for taxonomy, count in taxonomy_counts.items():
    percentage = (count / total_concepts) * 100
    print(f"{taxonomy}: {count} concepts ({percentage:.1f}%)")

# Generate chart data
print("\nChart data:")
print("data: [", end="")
print(", ".join([str(count) for count in taxonomy_counts.values()]), end="")
print("]")
```

### Customizing Colors

Modify the background colors for different taxonomy categories:

```javascript
backgroundColor: [
    'rgba(239, 83, 80, 0.9)',      // Red - FOUND
    'rgba(255, 112, 67, 0.9)',     // Orange - BASIC
    'rgba(255, 202, 40, 0.9)',     // Yellow - ARCH
    'rgba(156, 204, 101, 0.9)',    // Light Green - IMPL
    'rgba(102, 187, 106, 0.9)',    // Green - DATA
    'rgba(38, 198, 218, 0.9)',     // Light Blue - TOOL
    'rgba(66, 165, 245, 0.9)',     // Blue - QUAL
    'rgba(126, 87, 194, 0.9)'      // Purple - ADV
]
```

### Adding/Removing Categories

To add a new category:

1. Add to `labels` array: `'NEWCAT: X concepts (Y%)'`
2. Add count to `data` array
3. Add color to `backgroundColor` and `borderColor` arrays
4. Update category descriptions in tooltip callbacks
5. Add detail card in HTML

### Updating Quality Metrics

Update the quality indicator calculations in the HTML based on your data:

```html
<div class="indicator-item success">
    <span class="check-icon">✓</span>
    <span class="indicator-text">No category exceeds 30%</span>
</div>
```

Change to warning if condition not met:

```html
<div class="indicator-item warning">
    <span class="check-icon">⚠</span>
    <span class="indicator-text">WARNING: BASIC exceeds 30%</span>
</div>
```

## Analysis Metrics

### Balance Score

Calculate a balance score to assess distribution health:

```python
import numpy as np

# Expected even distribution
expected_pct = 100 / len(taxonomy_counts)

# Calculate variance from expected
variance = np.var([pct for pct in taxonomy_percentages])

# Balance score (0-100, higher is more balanced)
balance_score = max(0, 100 - variance)

print(f"Balance Score: {balance_score:.1f}/100")
```

### Coverage Assessment

Check for gaps and dominance:

```python
# Check for gaps (categories with < 5%)
gaps = [cat for cat, pct in taxonomy_pcts.items() if pct < 5]

# Check for dominance (categories with > 30%)
dominant = [cat for cat, pct in taxonomy_pcts.items() if pct > 30]

# Check for comprehensive coverage (all categories represented)
comprehensive = len(taxonomy_counts) >= 8

print(f"Gaps (< 5%): {gaps}")
print(f"Dominant (> 30%): {dominant}")
print(f"Comprehensive: {comprehensive}")
```

### Progression Analysis

Verify appropriate progression from basic to advanced:

```python
# Define expected progression (basic → advanced)
progression_order = ['FOUND', 'BASIC', 'ARCH', 'IMPL', 'DATA', 'TOOL', 'QUAL', 'ADV']

# Check if higher complexity categories have lower percentages
progression_valid = True
for i in range(len(progression_order) - 1):
    current = taxonomy_pcts[progression_order[i]]
    next_cat = taxonomy_pcts[progression_order[i + 1]]
    if next_cat > current + 10:  # Allow some flexibility
        progression_valid = False
        break

print(f"Appropriate progression: {progression_valid}")
```

## Use Cases

This visualization is useful for:

- **Curriculum balance assessment** - Ensure even coverage across concept types
- **Taxonomy validation** - Verify concepts are categorized appropriately
- **Gap identification** - Find underrepresented taxonomy categories
- **Complexity distribution** - Assess ratio of basic to advanced concepts

## Common Distribution Patterns

### Healthy Pattern: Gradual Taper
- FOUND: 5-10%
- BASIC: 20-25%
- Intermediate categories: 15-20% each
- Advanced: 2-8%
- **Assessment**: Balanced, appropriate complexity progression

### Warning Pattern: Top-Heavy
- FOUND: 25%
- BASIC: 30%
- Intermediate: 10% each
- Advanced: <5%
- **Issue**: Concepts may be too granular or lack depth

### Warning Pattern: Bottom-Heavy
- FOUND: <5%
- BASIC: <10%
- Intermediate: 15% each
- Advanced: 25%
- **Issue**: May be too complex, lacking foundational support

### Warning Pattern: Single Dominant Category
- One category: >35%
- Others: <10% each
- **Issue**: Curriculum imbalance, consider reorganizing taxonomy

3. Determine if any single category exceeds 30% (potential over-concentration)
4. Compare the largest and smallest categories - what's the ratio?

**Activity 2: Balance Evaluation (25 minutes)**

Using taxonomic distribution best practices:

1. Assess whether the distribution indicates good coverage across domains
2. Identify any categories that seem under-represented (<3%)
3. Evaluate if any categories could be merged due to semantic overlap
4. Propose an "ideal" distribution for a well-balanced course (percentages for each category)

**Activity 3: Interactive Chart Modification (30 minutes)**

1. Modify the Chart.js data array to represent your own course's concept distribution
2. Add a new taxonomy category and update colors appropriately
3. Implement hover tooltips showing concept count + percentage
4. Add a legend positioned to the right of the chart

**Activity 4: Create Custom Taxonomy (45 minutes)**

For a new course domain (e.g., "Introduction to Cybersecurity"):

1. Design 8-12 taxonomy categories that span the subject comprehensively
2. Assign 3-letter abbreviation codes to each category
3. Create a balanced target distribution (sum to 100%)
4. Generate a pie chart visualization with your taxonomy and target percentages
5. Write 2-3 sentences explaining your category choices
