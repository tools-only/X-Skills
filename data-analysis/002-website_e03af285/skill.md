# About the Claude Skills for Intelligent Textbooks Project

This website contains resources for using Anthropic Claude Skills to create
intelligent textbooks.  

Claude Code Skill or just "skills", are an ideal match for generating
intelligent textbooks.  Here is why.

1. **Token Efficient:** - Claude uses complex rules to only put a minimum of tokens
into the context window.  This means that teachers with only the $20/month Claude Pro plan
can generate full 500-page textbooks in a day.

2. **Automatic Invocation:** - Skills are used automatically when they are needed.  You
don't specifically have to tell Claude to invoke a skill.

3. **Ideal Match for Multi-Step Tasks:** - Skill often contain detailed step-by-step rules
with repeat cycles in them.  Building textbooks also requires the step-by-step
generation of learning graphs, followed step-by-step traversal of these graphs to generate
content and recommendations.  These steps are followed by rules that do rigorous quality checks.
 Skills are a perfect fit for our needs.

4. **Fantastic at Creating Consistent Standards-Compliant Content:** - We want all our content and
MicroSims to carefully follow rules for user interface consistency, quality an completeness.

Skills are not about extending the capabilities of LLMs or reaching deeper into databases and external resources for new data. This is what Model Context Protocol (MCP) standards do.

Skill focus on the consistent execution of rules in a way that only the minimum number of tokens need to be loaded into the context window.  Skills focus on the correct orchestration of the tools available for use to solve problems and they try
to do this within the main context window.  Skills work hard to update the current content windows so they can
bring in the relevant information as they need this information.

In contracts, agents spawn tasks that each have different context windows.  So they need a LOT of additional content sent to them to do their work.  This constant copying of context can be be slow and can be an expensive use of your token budgets.

In summary, if you have repeatable processes that need to be done in the same order in a consistent way, skills are a good fit for your problem.


Intelligent textbooks are interactive textbooks that
adapt to the needs of the student.  
Their core data structure is a concept [learning graph]() that serves as a roadmap for learners.
Our intelligent textbooks are generated by AI from course descriptions.
Our chapter generator skill create not just plain text, but a rich library of non-plain text elements
including lists, tables, charts, graphs and most importantly interactive education MicroSims.
