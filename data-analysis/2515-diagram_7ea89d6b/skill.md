# /diagram Skill

Generate architecture diagrams in multiple formats (C4, System Landscape, Data Flow, AWS).

## When to Use This Skill

Use `/diagram` when you need to create or update architecture visualizations:
- Create new C4 context/container/component diagrams
- Generate system landscape maps
- Visualize data flow architectures
- Create AWS infrastructure diagrams
- Diagram integration patterns
- Map system dependencies

## Usage

```
/diagram <type> [options]
```

### Diagram Types

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `c4-context` | C4 Level 1 - System context | Show external actors and system boundary |
| `c4-container` | C4 Level 2 - System containers | Show major components (services, databases) |
| `c4-component` | C4 Level 3 - Component level | Show detailed component interactions |
| `system-landscape` | Enterprise system map | Show all systems and connections |
| `data-flow` | Data movement diagram | Show how data moves through systems |
| `aws-architecture` | AWS infrastructure | Show EC2, RDS, S3, networking |
| `integration-pattern` | Integration architecture | Show message flows and patterns |
| `dependency-graph` | System dependencies | Show what depends on what |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Capture Requirements
When invoked, the skill asks:

1. **Diagram type** (required)
   - Options: c4-context, c4-container, system-landscape, data-flow, aws-architecture, integration-pattern, dependency-graph
   - Default: c4-context

2. **Scope** (required)
   - For C4: Which system/product?
   - For landscape: Which program/domain?
   - For AWS: Which account/region?
   - For data-flow: Which integration?

3. **Systems to include** (optional)
   - Comma-separated list of systems
   - Leave blank to auto-detect from context

4. **Styling preferences** (optional)
   - Color scheme: classic, muted, vibrant
   - Icon set: simple, detailed, minimalist
   - Default: classic, simple

5. **Output format** (optional)
   - `python` — PNG via Python `diagrams` library (default for AWS/landscape types)
   - `mermaid` — Inline Mermaid (default for C4 types; renders natively in Obsidian)
   - `plantuml` — C4-PlantUML with directional hints (for complex C4 layouts, >15 elements)
   - For C4 types (c4-context, c4-container, c4-component), suggest Mermaid or PlantUML and cross-reference `/c4-diagram` for data-driven generation from System note frontmatter

6. **Output location** (optional)
   - Save diagram in Canvas, Concept note, or embed in Note?
   - Default: Create standalone file

### Phase 2: Generate Diagram

The skill generates a Python script using the `diagrams` package:

```python
from diagrams import Diagram, Cluster, Edge
from diagrams.aws.compute import EKS, EC2
from diagrams.aws.database import RDS
from diagrams.aws.storage import S3
from diagrams.onprem.queue import Kafka
from diagrams.onprem.analytics import Spark

with Diagram("System Landscape", show=False, direction="TB"):
    # Your architecture here
```

#### Layout Science (Mermaid/PlantUML formats)

When generating Mermaid or PlantUML output (not Python):

- **Declaration order matters** — declare elements in reading order (left-to-right or top-to-bottom). The Dagre/Sugiyama algorithm positions elements based on declaration sequence.
- **Tier-based ordering** — Actors → Presentation → API → Services → Data → External
- **Edge crossing targets** — <5 for complex diagrams, 0 for simple ones. Crossings are the strongest predictor of comprehension difficulty (Purchase et al.).
- **Use subgraphs/boundaries** to group related elements (Gestalt proximity principle).

For C4-specific layout guidance including iterative refinement and PlantUML directional hints, see the `/c4-diagram` skill.

### Phase 3: Render and Save

The skill:
1. Executes the Python script
2. Generates PNG image
3. Creates markdown note with embedded diagram
4. Saves to vault as Canvas or Concept note
5. Links to related System/Integration notes

### Phase 4: Validation Checklist

After rendering, validate against these criteria:

| Criterion                     | Target                           | How to Check                             |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Edge crossings**            | <5 for complex, 0 for simple     | Trace each relationship path visually    |
| **Visual hierarchy**          | System boundary most prominent   | Is the boundary immediately identifiable? |
| **Grouping**                  | Related elements close together  | Do tiers/layers appear as distinct groups? |
| **Flow direction**            | Consistent L→R or T→B            | Does data flow follow one direction?     |
| **Relationship traceability** | Can follow each line             | Trace each connection without confusion  |
| **Abstraction level**         | One level per diagram            | No database tables on container diagrams |

If any criterion fails, revise the diagram before presenting to the user. For Mermaid: reorder declarations to match data flow. For PlantUML: add directional hints (`Rel_Down`, `Lay_Right`). See `/c4-diagram` skill for detailed refinement guidance.

## Format Selection Guide

| Scenario                               | Format         | Reason                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| AWS infrastructure, cloud icons        | `python`       | Rich icon library, professional PNG output           |
| System landscape, presentations        | `python`       | Best for standalone images and Confluence            |
| Quick C4 diagram in Obsidian           | `mermaid`      | Native rendering, Git-friendly, fast iteration       |
| C4 from System note frontmatter        | `mermaid`      | Use `/c4-diagram` for data-driven generation         |
| Complex C4 with persistent crossings   | `plantuml`     | Directional hints fix crossings Mermaid cannot       |
| >15 elements in a C4 diagram           | `plantuml`     | Layout control prevents chaos at scale               |
| Formal documentation, PDF export       | `plantuml`     | Automatic legends, consistent server-side rendering  |

## Output Formats

The skill generates:

1. **PNG image** - High-resolution diagram
2. **Markdown note** - With embedded image and metadata
3. **Canvas file** - Interactive Obsidian Canvas view (for diagram types: system-landscape, c4-*, aws-architecture)
4. **YAML frontmatter** - Includes diagram metadata for queryability:
   ```yaml
   type: Canvas
   title: "System Landscape"
   diagramType: system-landscape
   scope: Enterprise
   systems: [SAP, AlertHub, Snowflake, Kong, AWS]
   latencyTarget: null
   refreshedDate: 2026-01-14
   ```

## Quality Indicators

Each generated diagram includes:

```yaml
# Quality Indicators
confidence: high               # Auto-generated from current data
freshness: current           # Just generated
source: synthetic            # Generated from note metadata
verified: false              # Needs manual review
reviewed: null
```

## Refresh Strategy

Diagrams are regenerated:

1. **On demand** - User runs `/diagram` command
2. **On note update** - When linked System/Integration notes change (manual trigger: `/diagram --refresh`)
3. **Weekly** - Automated task to refresh all Canvas diagrams (optional)

To refresh existing diagram:

```
/diagram refresh Canvas - System Landscape.md
```

## Integration with Other Skills

The `/diagram` skill works with:

- **`/system`** - Links diagrams to system notes
- **`/integration`** - Shows data flows from integration specs
- **`/architecture`** - Includes in HLD documentation
- **`/scenario-compare`** - Generates before/after diagrams
- **`/impact-analysis`** - Shows affected systems

## Error Handling

If diagram generation fails:

1. User is shown error message with diagnostics
2. Suggests checking:
   - System names match note titles
   - Integration directions are valid
   - AWS account/region exists
3. Offers to generate with fewer systems
4. Falls back to Mermaid text diagram (if Python fails)

## Examples from This Vault

These Canvas files were generated using the `/diagram` skill:

- `[[Canvas - System Landscape]]` - All enterprise systems
- `[[Canvas - C4 Context Diagram]]` - AlertHub context
- `[[Canvas - Data Flow Diagram]]` - SAP to Snowflake flow
- `[[Canvas - AWS Architecture]]` - Production infrastructure
- `[[Canvas - Scenario Comparison]]` - Scenario alternatives

## Next Steps

After creating a diagram:

1. Review the PNG for accuracy
2. Adjust colors/layout if needed via `--style`, `--icons`, `--direction`
3. Add annotations via `/canvas-annotate` skill
4. Create scenario-specific variants via `/scenario-compare`
5. Include in architecture reviews and documentation
