# Agile Methodology

## Agile Principles

1. Individuals and interactions over processes
2. Working software over documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contracts
4. Responding to change over following plans

## Scrum Framework

### Roles
- **Product Owner**: Defines what to build
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates process
- **Development Team**: Builds the product

### Ceremonies

#### Sprint Planning
- Review backlog
- Select sprint goals
- Break into tasks

#### Daily Standup
- What did you do yesterday?
- What will you do today?
- Any blockers?

#### Sprint Review
- Demo completed work
- Gather feedback
- Update backlog

#### Sprint Retrospective
- What went well?
- What could improve?
- Action items

### Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**: Prioritized list of work
- **Sprint Backlog**: Work for current sprint
- **Increment**: Potentially shippable product

## Kanban

### Principles
- Visualize workflow
- Limit work in progress (WIP)
- Manage flow
- Make policies explicit

### Board Example
```
| To Do | In Progress (3) | Review | Done |
|-------|-----------------|--------|------|
| Task1 | Task4           | Task6  | Task7|
| Task2 | Task5           |        | Task8|
| Task3 |                 |        |      |
```

## Metrics

### Velocity
Story points completed per sprint.

### Lead Time
Time from request to delivery.

### Cycle Time
Time from start to completion.

### Work in Progress
Number of items being worked on.

## Best Practices

1. Keep sprints short (1-2 weeks)
2. Definition of Done is clear
3. Backlog is prioritized
4. Retrospectives lead to action
5. Demos are regular
