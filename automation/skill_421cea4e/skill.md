# Account Tiering Systems Skill

## When to Use
- Establishing T1/T2/T3 definitions for new ABM programs.
- Auditing existing tiers to ensure they reflect current revenue priorities.
- Aligning sales, marketing, and partner teams on coverage and SLA expectations.

## Framework
1. **Firmographic Fit** – revenue, employee count, industry, region.
2. **Propensity Signals** – intent, product usage, previous engagement, open opportunities.
3. **Strategic Value** – partnership potential, brand influence, expansion runway.
4. **Capacity Planning** – match tiers to owner bandwidth (SDR, AE, marketing pods).
5. **SLA Definitions** – touch frequency, personalization level, reporting cadence by tier.

## Templates
- **Tiering Matrix**: See `assets/tiering_matrix.md` for criteria and scoring logic.
- **Coverage planner** (tier → owner type → touch expectations).
- **Governance checklist** (review cadence, data sources, exception handling).

## Tips
- Recalculate tiers quarterly or when GTM strategy shifts.
- Keep a single truth source (sheet or CDP) to avoid conflicting tiers.
- Document exceptions (e.g., strategic design partners) so automation logic stays clean.
