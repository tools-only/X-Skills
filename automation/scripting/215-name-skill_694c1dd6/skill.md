# Find WeaponBuy

Locate `WeaponBuy` (item purchase handler) in CS2 server.dll or server.so using IDA Pro MCP tools.

## Method

1. Search for the string:
   ```
   mcp__ida-pro-mcp__find_regex pattern="item_purchase"
   ```

2. Get cross-references to the string:
   ```
   mcp__ida-pro-mcp__xrefs_to addrs="<string_addr>"
   ```

3. Decompile the referencing function:
   ```
   mcp__ida-pro-mcp__decompile addr="<function_addr>"
   ```

4. Verify the function:
   - Look for the "item_purchase" game event being created and fired
   - The function should handle weapon/item purchasing logic
   - Typical pattern involves:
     - Creating game event with "item_purchase"
     - Setting event fields like "userid", "team", "loadout", "weapon"
     - Firing the event

5. Rename the function:
   ```
   mcp__ida-pro-mcp__rename batch={"func": [{"addr": "<function_addr>", "name": "WeaponBuy"}]}
   ```

6. Generate and validate unique signature:

   **ALWAYS** Use SKILL `/generate-signature-for-function` to generate a robust and unique signature for the function.

7. Write IDA analysis output as YAML beside the binary:

   **ALWAYS** Use SKILL `/write-func-as-yaml` to write the analysis results.

   Required parameters:
   - `func_name`: `WeaponBuy`
   - `func_addr`: The function address from step 3
   - `func_sig`: The validated signature from step 6

   Note: This is NOT a virtual function, so no vtable parameters are needed.

## String References

The function uses the `item_purchase` game event string which is used when a player buys a weapon or item.

## Function Characteristics

- **Purpose**: Handles item/weapon purchases by players
- **Game Event**: Fires `item_purchase` event with details about the purchase
- **Event Fields**:
  - `userid`: Player who made the purchase
  - `team`: Team of the purchasing player
  - `loadout`: Loadout slot information
  - `weapon`: The weapon/item that was purchased

## Key Behaviors

1. Validates the purchase request
2. Creates the `item_purchase` game event
3. Populates event with purchase details
4. Fires the event to notify the game system

## DLL Information

- **DLL**: `server.dll` (Windows) / `server.so` (Linux)

## Notes

- This is a regular function, NOT a virtual function
- No vtable information is needed for this function
- The function is central to the buy system in CS2
- Multiple references to "item_purchase" may exist; look for the main purchase handler

## Output YAML Format

The output YAML filename depends on the platform:
- `server.dll` -> `WeaponBuy.windows.yaml`
- `server.so` -> `WeaponBuy.linux.yaml`

```yaml
func_va: 0x180XXXXXX      # Virtual address of the function - This can change when game updates.
func_rva: 0xXXXXXX        # Relative virtual address (VA - image base) - This can change when game updates.
func_size: 0xXXX          # Function size in bytes - This can change when game updates.
func_sig: XX XX XX XX XX  # Unique byte signature for pattern scanning - This can change when game updates.
```
