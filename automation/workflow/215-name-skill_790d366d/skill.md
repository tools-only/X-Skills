# CI Pipeline Synthesizer

## Overview

Generate production-ready GitHub Actions workflow files for library and package projects with automated build and test stages, dependency caching, and multi-version testing matrices.

## Workflow

### 1. Identify Project Type

Determine the package ecosystem by examining project files:
- **Node.js/npm**: `package.json` present
- **Python**: `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`, or `requirements.txt` present
- **Go**: `go.mod` present
- **Rust**: `Cargo.toml` present

### 2. Select Template

Use the appropriate template from `assets/` based on project type:
- `github-actions-nodejs.yml` - Node.js/npm packages
- `github-actions-python.yml` - Python packages
- `github-actions-go.yml` - Go modules
- `github-actions-rust.yml` - Rust crates

### 3. Customize Configuration

Adapt the template to project-specific needs:

**Test commands**: Update test scripts to match project conventions
- Node.js: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`
- Python: `pytest`, `python -m unittest`
- Go: `go test ./...`
- Rust: `cargo test`

**Build commands**: Adjust build steps if needed
- Node.js: `npm run build` (if build step exists)
- Python: `python -m build`
- Go: `go build`
- Rust: `cargo build --release`

**Version matrix**: Modify tested versions based on support policy
- Node.js: LTS versions (16.x, 18.x, 20.x)
- Python: Active versions (3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)
- Go: Recent versions (1.21, 1.22)
- Rust: stable, beta (optional)

**Trigger conditions**: Adjust when pipeline runs
- Default: Push to main/master, all pull requests
- Custom: Specific branches, paths, or schedules

### 4. Place Workflow File

Create the workflow file at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in the project root. If `.github/workflows/` doesn't exist, create the directory structure first.

### 5. Verify Configuration

Check that the generated workflow:
- Uses appropriate actions versions (e.g., `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-node@v4`)
- Includes dependency caching for faster builds
- Runs on appropriate triggers (push, pull_request)
- Tests against relevant version matrices
- Has clear job and step names

## Template Features

All templates include:
- **Dependency caching**: Speeds up builds by caching package managers
- **Matrix testing**: Tests across multiple language/runtime versions
- **Parallel execution**: Runs tests for different versions concurrently
- **Clear naming**: Descriptive job and step names for easy debugging
- **Best practices**: Uses recommended actions and configurations

## Customization Examples

**Add code coverage reporting**:
```yaml
- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    file: ./coverage.xml
```

**Add linting step**:
```yaml
- name: Run linter
  run: npm run lint  # or: pylint, golangci-lint, cargo clippy
```

**Restrict to specific branches**:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
```

**Add scheduled runs**:
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday
```

## Tips

- Start with the template and customize incrementally
- Test the workflow by creating a pull request or pushing to a test branch
- Use `actions/cache` for dependencies to reduce build times
- Keep matrix versions current with language support policies
- Add status badges to README.md: `![CI](https://github.com/user/repo/workflows/CI/badge.svg)`
