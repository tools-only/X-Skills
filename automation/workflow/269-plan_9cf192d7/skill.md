Invoke the planning-with-files:planning-with-files skill and follow it exactly as presented to you.

Create the three planning files in the current project directory if they don't exist:
- task_plan.md — for phases, progress, and decisions
- findings.md — for research and discoveries
- progress.md — for session logging

Then guide the user through the planning workflow.
