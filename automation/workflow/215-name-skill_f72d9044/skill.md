description:
  Expert guidance for working with Dagster and the dg CLI. ALWAYS use before doing any task that requires
  knowledge specific to Dagster, or that references assets, materialization, or data pipelines.
  Common tasks may include creating a new project, adding new definitions, understanding the current project structure, answering general questions about the codebase (finding asset, schedule, sensor, component or job definitions), debugging issues, or providing deep information about a specific Dagster concept.

# Dagster Expert Skill

Expert guidance for building production-quality Dagster projects. Routes you to detailed reference documentation for assets, automation, project structure, and CLI commands.

> **IMPORTANT**: For new assets, schedules, or sensors, ALWAYS use `dg scaffold` before manual file creation. See [cli/scaffold.md](references/cli/scaffold.md).

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Project Setup
uvx create-dagster project <name> --uv-sync  # --uv-sync creates venv and installs deps
uvx create-dagster workspace <name>          # For multiple related projects
# Output confirms success—no verification needed

# Scaffold (ALWAYS use for new definitions)
dg scaffold defs dagster.asset defs/assets/my_asset.py
dg scaffold defs dagster.schedule defs/schedules/daily.py
dg scaffold defs dagster.sensor defs/sensors/file_watcher.py

# Discover
dg list defs
dg list defs --assets "group:analytics"
dg list components

# Validate
dg check defs

# Launch
dg launch --assets "tag:priority=high"
dg launch --assets "+my_asset"  # with upstream
dg launch --assets my_asset --partition 2024-01-15
```

## Core Dagster Concepts

Brief definitions only (see reference files for detailed examples):

- **Asset**: Persistent object (table, file, model) produced by your pipeline
- **Job**: Selection of assets to execute together
- **Schedule**: Time-based automation using cron
- **Sensor**: Event-driven automation that watches for changes
- **Declarative Automation**: Modern automation where you set conditions on assets
- **Partition**: Logical division of data (by date, category)
- **Component**: Reusable, declarative building block (YAML-based)

## UV Compatibility

Projects use `uv` for dependency management:

```bash
uv run dg list defs
uv run dg launch --assets my_asset
```
