# Creating PR with CI Verification

**IMPORTANT:** This command solves the common problem where Claude creates a PR, says "I'll wait for CI", then gives up. This command ACTUALLY waits for CI completion.

## Workflow

This command will:
1. ✅ Create PR as draft
2. ✅ Wait for CI checks to complete (actually wait, not give up)
3. ✅ Mark as ready for review if CI passes
4. ✅ **Automatically trigger /fix-pr if CI fails** (new!)

## Step 1: Determine Current Branch and Changes

```bash
# Get current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Get base branch (usually main or master)
BASE_BRANCH=$(git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch' | cut -d' ' -f5)

# Verify we're not on main/master
if [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" == "main" || "$CURRENT_BRANCH" == "master" ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: Cannot create PR from main/master branch"
  echo "Create a feature branch first: git checkout -b feature-name"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if branch is pushed
git rev-parse --verify origin/$CURRENT_BRANCH > /dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Branch not pushed yet. Pushing now..."
  git push -u origin $CURRENT_BRANCH
fi
```

## Step 2: Gather PR Context

Run in parallel to gather information:

```bash
# 1. Git status
git status

# 2. Diff since divergence from base
git diff ${BASE_BRANCH}...HEAD

# 3. Commit history for this branch
git log ${BASE_BRANCH}..HEAD --oneline

# 4. Check if PR already exists
gh pr view --json number,state,isDraft 2>/dev/null
```

**If PR already exists:**
```bash
EXISTING_PR=$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number')
echo "PR #$EXISTING_PR already exists for this branch"
echo "Use /review-pr $EXISTING_PR or /fix-pr $EXISTING_PR instead"
exit 0
```

## Step 3: Create PR Title and Body

Based on the changes (read from git diff and commit history):

**Title:** Concise summary of changes (50 chars max)

**Body format:**
```markdown
## Summary
- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2

## Changes
- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2

## Testing
- Test approach
- Verification steps

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Code formatted (make format)
- [ ] Changelog entry created (if applicable)

## Step 4: Create PR as Draft

**CRITICAL:** Always create as draft initially.

```bash
# Create PR as draft
# CRITICAL: Use --repo flag to create PR in upstream repo from fork
# This creates cross-fork PR: your-fork:branch → PolicyEngine:master
gh pr create --repo PolicyEngine/policyengine-us \
  --title "PR Title Here" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
PR body here
EOF
)" \
  --draft

# Get PR number
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number')
echo "Created draft PR #$PR_NUMBER"
echo "URL: $(gh pr view --json url --jq '.url')"
```

## Step 5: Wait for CI Checks (DO NOT GIVE UP!)

**This is where Claude usually fails. DO NOT say "I'll check back later".**

**Instead, ACTUALLY wait using a polling loop with NO timeout:**

```bash
echo "Waiting for CI checks to complete..."
echo "Typical CI times by repository:"
echo "  - policyengine-app: 3-6 minutes"
echo "  - policyengine-uk: 9-12 minutes"
echo "  - policyengine-api: 30 minutes"
echo "  - policyengine-us: 60-75 minutes (longest)"
echo ""
echo "I will poll every 15 seconds until all checks complete. No time limit."

POLL_INTERVAL=15  # Check every 15 seconds
ELAPSED=0

while true; do
  # Get check status
  CHECKS_JSON=$(gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER --json name,status,conclusion)

  # Count checks
  TOTAL=$(echo "$CHECKS_JSON" | jq '. | length')

  if [ "$TOTAL" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "No CI checks found yet. Waiting for checks to start..."
    sleep $POLL_INTERVAL
    ELAPSED=$((ELAPSED + POLL_INTERVAL))
    continue
  fi

  # Count by status
  COMPLETED=$(echo "$CHECKS_JSON" | jq '[.[] | select(.status == "COMPLETED")] | length')
  FAILED=$(echo "$CHECKS_JSON" | jq '[.[] | select(.conclusion == "FAILURE")] | length')

  echo "[$ELAPSED s] CI Checks: $COMPLETED/$TOTAL completed, $FAILED failed"

  # If all completed
  if [ "$COMPLETED" -eq "$TOTAL" ]; then
    if [ "$FAILED" -eq 0 ]; then
      echo "✅ All CI checks passed after $ELAPSED seconds!"
      break
    else
      echo "❌ Some CI checks failed after $ELAPSED seconds."
      # Show failures
      gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER
      break
    fi
  fi

  # Continue waiting (no timeout!)
  sleep $POLL_INTERVAL
  ELAPSED=$((ELAPSED + POLL_INTERVAL))
done
```

**Important:** No timeout means we actually wait as long as needed. Population simulations can take 30+ minutes.

## Step 6: Mark Ready for Review (If CI Passed) or Auto-Fix (If CI Failed)

```bash
if [ "$FAILED" -eq 0 ] && [ "$COMPLETED" -eq "$TOTAL" ]; then
  echo "Marking PR as ready for review..."
  gh pr ready $PR_NUMBER

  echo ""
  echo "✅ PR #$PR_NUMBER is ready for review!"
  echo "URL: $(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json url --jq '.url')"
  echo ""
  echo "All CI checks passed:"
  gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER
else
  echo ""
  echo "❌ CI checks failed. PR remains as draft."
  echo "URL: $(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json url --jq '.url')"
  echo ""
  echo "Failed checks:"
  gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER
  echo ""
  echo "🔧 Automatically triggering /fix-pr to address CI failures..."
  echo ""
fi
```

**If CI failed, automatically trigger fix-pr command:**

After detecting CI failures, invoke the `/fix-pr` command to automatically attempt to fix the issues. This ensures the PR doesn't stay broken and saves user intervention.

The `/fix-pr` command will:
1. Analyze the CI failures
2. Apply appropriate fixes (formatting, linting, test failures)
3. Push the fixes
4. Wait for CI to pass again
5. Mark PR as ready once all checks pass


## Key Differences from Default Behavior

**Old way (Claude gives up):**
```
Claude: "I've created the PR. CI will take a while, I'll check back later..."
[Chat ends, Claude never checks back]
User: Has to manually check CI and mark ready
```

**New way (this command waits and auto-fixes):**
```
Claude: "I've created the PR as draft. Now waiting for CI..."
[Actually polls CI status every 15 seconds]

Scenario A - CI passes:
Claude: "CI passed! Marking as ready for review."
[PR is ready, user doesn't have to do anything]

Scenario B - CI fails:
Claude: "CI failed. Automatically triggering /fix-pr..."
[Analyzes failures, applies fixes, pushes changes]
[Waits for CI again, marks ready when passes]
[User doesn't have to do anything]
```

## Error Handling

**If CI fails:**

The command automatically triggers `/fix-pr` to handle failures. No manual intervention needed in most cases.

The auto-fix will handle:
- Linting errors: `make format && git push`
- Import sorting: `isort`
- Test failures: Analyzed and delegated to appropriate agents
- Changelog validation: Creates missing entries
- Reference validation: Fixes parameter references

**If no CI configured:**
```bash
if [ "$TOTAL" -eq 0 ] && [ $ELAPSED -gt 60 ]; then
  echo "⚠️ No CI checks detected after 60 seconds."
  echo "Repository may not have CI configured."
  echo "Marking PR as ready for manual review."
  gh pr ready $PR_NUMBER
fi
```

## Usage Examples

**Basic:**
```bash
# Make changes, commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature"

# Create PR (command waits for CI)
/create-pr
```

**With custom title:**
```bash
# Command can accept optional arguments
/create-pr "Add California EITC implementation"
```

**Checking existing PR:**
```bash
# If PR exists, command tells you and suggests alternatives
/create-pr
# Output: "PR #123 exists. Use /review-pr 123 or /fix-pr 123"
```

## Integration with Other Commands

**After /encode-policy or /fix-pr:**
```bash
# These commands might push code
# Use /create-pr to create PR and wait for CI
/create-pr
```

**After fixing CI issues:**
```bash
# Fix issues locally
make format
git add .
git commit -m "Fix linting"
git push

# Command will detect existing PR and re-check CI
/create-pr  # "PR #123 exists, checking CI status..."
```

## CI Duration Expectations

**By repository (based on actual data):**
- **policyengine-app:** 3-6 minutes (fast)
- **policyengine-uk:** 9-12 minutes (medium)
- **policyengine-api:** ~30 minutes (slow)
- **policyengine-us:** 60-75 minutes (very slow - population simulations)

**The command has no timeout** - it will wait as long as needed, even for policyengine-us's 75-minute CI runs.

## Why This Works

**Problem:** Claude's internal timeout or context leads it to give up

**Solution:**
1. ✅ Explicit polling loop (Claude sees the code will wait)
2. ✅ Clear status updates (Claude knows it's still working)
3. ✅ Timeout is explicit (Claude knows how long to wait)
4. ✅ Fallback handling (What to do if timeout occurs)

**Key insight:** By having the command contain the waiting logic in bash, Claude executes it and actually waits instead of just saying "I'll wait."

## Notes

**This command is essential for:**
- Automated PR workflows
- CI-dependent merges
- Team workflows requiring CI validation
- Reducing manual PR management

**Use this instead of:**
- Manual `gh pr create` followed by manual CI checking
- Asking Claude to "wait for CI" (which it can't do reliably)
- Creating ready PRs before CI passes
