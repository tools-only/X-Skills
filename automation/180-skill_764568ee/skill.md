## Capability Decision Logic

### Tolerance Selection Guide

| Required Tolerance | Recommended Route |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| ±0.003mm or tighter | HARDINGE turning, CITIZEN Swiss, Wire EDM |
| ±0.005mm | DMG MORI ALX2000, Swiss machines |
| ±0.010mm | Standard DMG MORI turning/milling |
| ±0.050mm | Haas fast response cell |
| Looser | Any machine, optimize for cycle time |

### Part Type Routing

**Turned Parts (rotational):**
```
IF diameter > 200mm → CANNOT MAKE (max Ø270mm on Hardinge)
IF diameter > 150mm AND tolerance < ±0.005mm → HARDINGE only
IF diameter ≤ 50mm AND high volume → CITIZEN Swiss
IF length > 700mm → CANNOT MAKE (max Z700mm on NLX2500 Single)
IF tolerance ≤ ±0.003mm → HARDINGE or CITIZEN
ELSE → DMG MORI NLX2500 (twin for short parts, single for long)
```

**Milled Parts (prismatic):**
```
IF any dimension > 700mm → CANNOT MAKE
IF 5-axis required AND part ≤ 470x350x510mm → NMV3000 (best automation)
IF 5-axis required AND part ≤ 650x650x550mm → DMU50
IF 4-axis sufficient AND part ≤ 700x500x450mm → Vertical VMC
IF simple prototype → Haas Mini Mill
```

**Complex Geometries:**
```
IF hardened material (>50 HRC) → EDM route
IF sharp internal corners required → Wire EDM
IF through-profile cuts → Wire EDM
IF cavity/pocket in hardened steel → Spark EDM
```

### Material Considerations

| Material Type | Notes |
|---------------|-------|
| Aluminium | All machines, optimize speeds |
| Stainless (303/304/316) | Consider CITIZEN LFV for chip breaking |
| Titanium | 5-axis mills, reduce speeds, rigid setups |
| Inconel/Hastelloy | Reduced feeds, consider EDM for features |
| Hardened steel (>50 HRC) | EDM only for machining, or machine before hardening |
| Plastics/Delrin | Swiss machines excellent, watch for heat |
| Brass/Bronze | All machines, free-machining |

## Example Queries and Responses

**Query:** "Can we turn a Ø150mm x 400mm shaft in 316SS to ±0.008mm?"
**Response:** YES - Use DMG MORI NLX2500 Single Spindle
- Diameter OK: Ø150mm < Ø200mm capacity
- Length OK: 400mm < 700mm Z-travel
- Tolerance OK: ±0.008mm achievable (machine capable of ±0.010mm)
- Material: 316SS fine, consider live tooling for any milled features

**Query:** "Can we make a 5-axis aerospace bracket 500x400x300mm in Ti-6Al-4V?"
**Response:** YES - Use DMG MORI DMU50
- Envelope OK: 500x400x300 fits in 650x650x550mm
- 5-axis capability: Yes
- Material: Titanium requires reduced parameters, rigid fixturing
- Note: NMV3000 too small (470x350x510mm)

**Query:** "Small precision medical pin Ø3mm x 25mm, ±0.002mm tolerance, 10,000 qty?"
**Response:** MARGINAL - CITIZEN Swiss closest but tolerance challenging
- Size OK: Well within Ø50mm capacity
- Volume: Swiss machines ideal for high volume
- Tolerance: ±0.002mm tighter than ±0.003mm capability
- Recommendation: Discuss with engineering - may need post-process grinding or accept ±0.003mm
