# FSM Architecture Guide

> Design agent behavior as a finite state machine with deterministic nodes and explicit transitions.

## Why FSM Architecture?

### The Problem with Prompt-Only Agents

| Anti-Pattern | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **ReAct Pattern** | Agents get stuck in reasoning loops without guardrails |
| **Doom-Prompting** | Prompts grow exponentially to handle edge cases |
| **Goal Drift** | Agents forget original intent after several turns |

> **KEY INSIGHT**: "LLMs are non-deterministic by design. Without structured control flow, enterprise agents become unpredictable, expensive, and impossible to debug."

### The FSM Solution

| FSM Concept | Traffic Light Example | Agent Benefit |
|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **States** | Red, Green, Yellow | Agent always knows exactly what it's doing |
| **Transitions** | Timer expires | No ambiguity about what happens next |
| **Determinism** | Red → Green (guaranteed) | Auditable, testable, trustworthy |

---

## The Three FSM Pillars

| Pillar | Definition | Agent Benefit |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **States** | Distinct "modes" the system can be in | Clear context at any moment |
| **Transitions** | Explicit rules for moving between states | Defined paths, no surprises |
| **Determinism** | Same input → same output | Auditable and testable |

## The 5 Node Patterns

### Pattern Overview

| Pattern | Color | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| 🔵 **ROUTING** | Blue | Routes based on intent |
| 🔵 **VERIFICATION** | Light Blue | Security checks |
| 🟡 **DATA-LOOKUP** | Yellow | External data fetch |
| 🟢 **PROCESSING** | Green | Business logic |
| 🔴 **HANDOFF** | Red | Human escalation |

---

### Pattern 1: ROUTING (Topic Selector)

**Purpose**: Routes conversations based on detected intent

```yaml
start_agent topic_selector:
  description: "Route to appropriate topic based on intent"
  reasoning:
    instructions: ->
      | You are the support agent.
        Classify the customer's intent and route:
        - Refund requests go to identity verification
        - General inquiries are handled directly
    actions:
      start_refund: @utils.transition to @topic.identity_verification
        description: "Customer wants a refund"
      handle_inquiry: @utils.transition to @topic.general_support
        description: "General question or inquiry"
```

**When to Use**: Entry point for multi-purpose agents

---

### Pattern 2: VERIFICATION (Identity Gate)

**Purpose**: Enforces security checks before proceeding

```yaml
topic identity_verification:
  description: "Verify customer identity before refund"
  reasoning:
    instructions: ->
      if @variables.failed_attempts >= 3:
        | Too many failed attempts. Escalating to human agent.
      if @variables.email_verified == True:
        | Identity verified. Proceed to risk assessment.
      else:
        | Ask customer to verify their email address.
    actions:
      verify_email: @actions.verify_email
        description: "Verify customer email"
        with email = @variables.customer_email
        set @variables.email_verified = @outputs.verified
      proceed: @utils.transition to @topic.risk_assessment
        description: "Continue to risk assessment"
        available when @variables.email_verified == True
      escalate: @utils.escalate
        description: "Transfer to human agent"
        available when @variables.failed_attempts >= 3
```

**When to Use**: Before accessing sensitive data or actions

---

### Pattern 3: DATA-LOOKUP (Risk Assessment)

**Purpose**: Fetches data from external sources

```yaml
topic risk_assessment:
  description: "Fetch customer data and assess churn risk"
  reasoning:
    instructions: ->
      | Fetch customer profile using the action.
        Once loaded, review:
        - Churn Risk: {!@variables.churn_risk_score}%
        - Lifetime Value: {!@variables.lifetime_value}
    actions:
      get_profile: @actions.get_customer_profile
        description: "Load customer data from CRM"
        with customer_id = @variables.customer_id
        set @variables.churn_risk_score = @outputs.churn_risk
        set @variables.lifetime_value = @outputs.ltv
      process_refund: @utils.transition to @topic.refund_processor
        description: "Continue to refund processing"
```

**When to Use**: When decisions require external data

---

### Pattern 4: PROCESSING (Refund Processor)

**Purpose**: Applies business logic based on conditions

```yaml
topic refund_processor:
  description: "Process refund based on churn risk"
  reasoning:
    instructions: ->
      if @variables.churn_risk_score >= 80:
        | HIGH CHURN RISK - Approve full refund.
      if @variables.churn_risk_score < 80:
        | LOW CHURN RISK - Offer partial credit.
    actions:
      approve_full: @actions.process_refund
        available when @variables.churn_risk_score >= 80
        with amount = @variables.order_total
        with type = "full"
      offer_credit: @actions.issue_credit
        available when @variables.churn_risk_score < 80
        with amount = 10
```

**When to Use**: Applying business rules to data

---

### Pattern 5: HANDOFF (Escalation)

**Purpose**: Transfers conversation to human agent

```yaml
topic escalation:
  description: "Escalate to human agent"
  reasoning:
    instructions: ->
      | Customer has failed verification 3 times.
        Escalating to a human agent for assistance.
    actions:
      handoff: @utils.escalate
        description: "Transfer to human agent"
```

**When to Use**: Failed verification, complex issues, customer request

## Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Hub and Spoke

Central router to specialized topics.

```
       ┌─────────────┐
       │ topic_sel   │
       │   (hub)     │
       └──────┬──────┘
    ┌─────────┼─────────┐

┌─────────┐┌─────────┐┌──────────┐
│ account ││payments ││ settings │
│(protect)││(protect)││(protected)│
└─────────┘└─────────┘└──────────┘
```

**When to Use**: Sensitive data, payments, PII access

## Deterministic vs. Subjective Classification

### Classification Framework

| Put in Deterministic Nodes if... | Put in Subjective Reasoning if... |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Security/safety requirement | Conversational/greeting |
| Financial threshold | Context understanding needed |
| Data fetch required | Natural language generation |
| Counter/state management | Flexible interpretation needed |
| Hard cutoff rule | Response explanation |

### Examples

| Requirement | Classification | Reasoning |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| "ALWAYS verify identity before refund" | **Deterministic** | Security - must be code-enforced |
| "Start with a friendly greeting" | **Subjective** | Conversational - LLM flexibility |
| "IF churn > 80, full refund" | **Deterministic** | Financial threshold - no exceptions |
| "Explain the refund status" | **Subjective** | Natural language generation |
| "Count failed verification attempts" | **Deterministic** | Counter logic - must be accurate |
| "Redirect off-topic questions" | **Subjective** | Context understanding required |

## State Machine Example: Pronto Refund Agent

```
                              ┌────────────────────┐
                              │ Identity           │  verified
                 refund       │ Verification       │─────────────┐
                 intent       │ (VERIFICATION)     │             │
┌────────────────┐           └─────────┬──────────┘             ▼
│ Topic Selector │──────────▶          │              ┌─────────────────┐
│   (ROUTING)    │                     │ failed 3x    │ Risk Assessment │
└────────────────┘                     │              │ (DATA-LOOKUP)   │
                                       │              └────────┬────────┘
                                       ▼                       │ score loaded
                              ┌────────────────┐               ▼
                              │  Escalation    │      ┌─────────────────┐
                              │  (HANDOFF)     │      │ Refund Processor│
                              └────────────────┘      │  (PROCESSING)   │
                                                      └─────────────────┘
```

### State Definitions

| State | Type | Entry Condition | Exit Conditions |
|-------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Topic Selector | ROUTING | Conversation start | Intent detected |
| Identity Verification | VERIFICATION | Refund intent | Verified OR 3 failures |
| Risk Assessment | DATA-LOOKUP | Identity verified | Score loaded |
| Refund Processor | PROCESSING | Score loaded | Refund complete |
| Escalation | HANDOFF | 3 failures | Human takeover |

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Single Responsibility per Topic
Each topic should handle ONE concern. If a topic does verification AND processing, split it.

### 2. Explicit Transitions
Always define how to enter AND exit each state. No dead ends.

### 3. Guard Sensitive Transitions
Use `available when` to make actions invisible when conditions aren't met.

```yaml
actions:
  process_payment: @actions.charge_card
    available when @variables.customer_verified == True
    # LLM literally cannot see this action if not verified
```

### 4. Design for the Happy Path First
Map the success flow, then add failure states.

### 5. Use Escalation as a Safety Net
When in doubt, escalate to human. It's better than a bad automated decision.
