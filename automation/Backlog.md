**Features to include**:
- YAML frontmatter schema validation with Pydantic models
- Auto-fix capabilities (arrays → comma-separated, multiline → single-line)
- Token-based complexity metrics (tiktoken) instead of line counts
- Cross-reference validation (agent references non-existent skill)
- Marketplace readiness scoring
- Pre-commit hook integration
- CLI with `--fix` and `--report` modes
**Current source**: `plugins/plugin-creator/scripts/validate_frontmatter.py`
**Suggested repo name**: `claude-plugin-lint` or `cc-plugin-validator`

### Research Resources

**Skill for research phase**: `/research-and-compare <methodology-name-or-url>`

- Produces structured comparison documents following SAM comparison template
- Includes overlap/divergence analysis, weakness discovery, implementation pairing
- Outputs to `methodology_development/.meta/v1_comparisons/`

**Existing SAM comparisons** (start here before running new research):

- [methodology_development/.meta/v1_comparisons/](../methodology_development/.meta/v1_comparisons/)
  - sam-vs-get-shit-done.md
  - sam-vs-bmad-method.md
  - sam-vs-gastown.md
  - sam-vs-taskmaster.md
  - sam-vs-octocode.md
  - sam-vs-superclaude.md
  - sam-vs-ralph-loop-orchestrator.md
  - sam-vs-cc-sessions.md
  - sam-vs-v-model.md
  - sam-infrastructure-layer.md

**Workflow for SAM gap items**:

1. Check existing comparisons for relevant findings
2. If more research needed: `/research-and-compare <framework>` for specific topics
3. Synthesize findings into SAM framework update
4. Mark backlog item complete
