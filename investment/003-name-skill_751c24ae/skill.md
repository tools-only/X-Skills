Strategic toolkit for business analysis, planning, and execution.

## Quick Start

2. **Select category** → Use decision tree below
3. **Apply framework** → Follow step-by-step instructions
4. **Document output** → Structured insights

## Framework Selection (Decision Tree)

│
├─ Make a decision
│  ├─ Compare 2-5 options → Decision Matrix
