# WNBA Data

## Setup

Before first use, check if the CLI is available:
```bash
which sports-skills || pip install sports-skills
```
If `pip install` fails with a Python version error, the package requires Python 3.10+. Find a compatible Python:
```bash
python3 --version  # check version
# If < 3.10, try: python3.12 -m pip install sports-skills
# On macOS with Homebrew: /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 -m pip install sports-skills
```
No API keys required.

## Quick Start

Prefer the CLI — it avoids Python import path issues:
```bash
sports-skills wnba get_scoreboard
sports-skills wnba get_standings --season=2025
sports-skills wnba get_teams
```

## Choosing the Season

Derive the current year from the system prompt's date (e.g., `currentDate: 2026-02-18` → current year is 2026).

- **If the user specifies a season**, use it as-is.
- **If the user says "current", "this season", or doesn't specify**: The WNBA season runs May–October. If the current month is May–October, use `season = current_year`. If November–April (offseason), use `season = current_year - 1` (most recently completed season).
- **Never hardcode a season.** Always derive it from the system date.

## Error Handling

When a command fails, **do not surface raw errors to the user**. Instead:
1. Catch silently and try alternatives
2. If team name given instead of ID, use `get_teams` to find the ID first
3. Only report failure with a clean message after exhausting alternatives

## Troubleshooting

- **`sports-skills` command not found**: Run `pip install sports-skills`
- **Team not found**: Use `get_teams` to list all teams and find the correct ID
- **No data for future games**: ESPN only returns data for completed or in-progress games
- **Offseason (Nov–Apr)**: `get_scoreboard` returns 0 events — expected. Use `get_standings --season=2025` or `get_news` instead.
