# Decision Frameworks: Deep Dives

Extended explanations and applications for each framework in the decision toolkit.

## First Principles Thinking

### Origin
Aristotle defined first principles as "the first basis from which a thing is known." Elon Musk popularized its modern application: breaking problems down to fundamental truths and reasoning up from there.

### The Five Questions

1. **What problem does this solve?**
   - Not "what does it do" but "what pain does it eliminate"
   - If you can't articulate the problem, the solution may be searching for one

2. **Can I solve it myself?**
   - With current skills, tools, or reasonable investment
   - Not "can someone solve it" but "can I"

3. **Is this the best solution?**
   - Compare to alternatives, including doing nothing
   - "Best" includes fit for your context, not just theoretical optimality

4. **What assumptions am I making?**
   - About the problem, the solution, the context
   - Assumptions are where first principles analysis adds most value

5. **If starting fresh today, would I choose this?**
   - The "clean slate" test
   - Removes sunk cost and path dependency

### Application Example

*Decision: Join a startup accelerator*

1. **Problem**: Need funding, network, and credibility to grow
2. **Solve myself?**: Can network independently (slower). Can't easily replicate funding access
3. **Best solution?**: Other accelerators? Angel investors? Bootstrapping?
4. **Assumptions**: Accelerator will actually provide value. Equity cost is worth it. My startup fits their focus.
5. **Fresh start?**: If I hadn't applied yet, would I? Yes — for network. Maybe — for funding.

### When to Use
- Evaluating opportunities with significant commitment
- When feeling pressured by external narratives
- When the "obvious" choice feels uncomfortable

## Opportunity Cost Calculator

### The Framework

```
Direct Cost = Hours × Rate
True Cost = Direct Cost + Best Alternative Value + Relationship/Growth Costs
```

### Components

**Direct Cost**
- Hours/week × weeks × hourly rate
- Use your actual billing rate, or time value equivalent

**Best Alternative Value**
- What would those hours produce if used differently?
- Not all alternatives — just the best one you'd actually pursue

**Relationship/Growth Costs**
- What connections might suffer from reduced attention?
- What skills won't develop because you're focused elsewhere?

### Application Example

*Decision: Take on a 10-hour/week consulting gig for 3 months*

| Component | Calculation | Value |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Direct time | 10h × 12 weeks | 120 hours |
| At rate | 120 × $200 | $24,000 |
| Best alternative | Could build feature worth ~$50K revenue | ~$50,000 |
| Relationship cost | Less time for key partnership | Hard to quantify |
| True opportunity cost | | $50,000+ |

**Insight**: The $24K consulting gig actually costs ~$50K in forgone product development.

### Common Mistakes

1. **Ignoring alternatives**: Focusing only on time, not what that time could create
2. **Undervaluing rest**: Recovery time has value; burnout has cost
3. **Ignoring compounding**: Small weekly investments compound; opportunity cost does too
4. **Only counting money**: Relationships, learning, and energy have value

## Scenario Matrix

### Structure

| Scenario | Probability | Outcome | Impact | Expected Value |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------|----------------|
| Worst | X% | Description | -$Y or equivalent | Prob × Impact |
| Bad | X% | | | |
| Neutral | X% | | | |
| Good | X% | | | |
| Best | X% | | | |
| **Total** | 100% | | | Sum |

### Probability Calibration

Most people are poorly calibrated. Use these anchors:

| Probability | Roughly means |
|-------------|---------------|
| 5% | "Unlikely but possible" |
| 20% | "Could happen" |
| 50% | "Coin flip" |
| 80% | "Probably" |
| 95% | "Almost certain" |

**Technique**: If you can't assign a probability, estimate "what odds would I accept if betting on this?"

### Application Example

*Decision: Launch product in January vs April*

| Scenario | Prob | January Launch | April Launch |
|----------|------|----------------|--------------|
| Market shifts | 20% | -$50K (too early) | -$20K (adapted) |
| Competitor launches | 15% | +$100K (first) | -$30K (second) |
| Product ready | 30% | +$200K | +$200K |
| Product buggy | 35% | -$80K (reputation) | +$180K (polished) |

**January EV**: (0.20×-50K) + (0.15×100K) + (0.30×200K) + (0.35×-80K) = +$27K
**April EV**: (0.20×-20K) + (0.15×-30K) + (0.30×200K) + (0.35×180K) = +$114.5K

**Insight**: April launch has higher expected value despite missing first-mover scenario.

## Pre-Mortem Analysis

### Origin
Gary Klein developed the pre-mortem in 1989. Unlike post-mortems (analyzing what went wrong after failure), pre-mortems imagine failure *before* it happens.

### The Process

1. **Assume failure**: "It's [future date]. This decision completely failed."
2. **Generate causes**: Brainstorm every possible reason for failure
3. **Categorize**: Which causes are within/outside your control?
4. **Identify signals**: What warning signs would precede each cause?
5. **Create triggers**: What will you do if you see those signals?

### Application Example

*Decision: Hire a new senior engineer*

**Imagine**: It's 6 months later. This hire was a disaster.

**Possible causes**:
1. Culture mismatch — brilliant but toxic to team
2. Skill mismatch — impressive resume, wrong tech stack
3. Motivation mismatch — wanted different type of work
4. Timing — we couldn't provide promised projects
5. Onboarding failure — we didn't set them up for success
6. External — they got a better offer and left

**Within control**: 1, 2, 3, 5 (interview better, onboard better)
**Outside control**: 4, 6 (market conditions)

**Warning signals**:
- Team complaints in first 2 weeks (cause 1)
- Struggles with core tasks (cause 2)
- Asks about different projects repeatedly (cause 3)

**Triggers**:
- Weekly 1:1s for first month focusing on fit
- 30/60/90 day technical assessments
- Explicit "are you getting what you expected" conversations

## 10-10-10 Framework

### Origin
Suzy Welch developed this framework to overcome short-term emotional reactions in decision-making.

### The Three Windows

**10 Minutes**: How will I feel immediately after deciding?
- Captures emotional reaction
- Often dominated by fear, excitement, or relief

**10 Months**: How will I feel after living with this decision?
- Captures medium-term consequences
- Initial emotions usually faded
- Actual outcomes starting to materialize

**10 Years**: How will I feel looking back on this decision?
- Captures long-term significance
- Most decisions barely remembered
- Regret patterns become clear

### Application Example

*Decision: Accept job offer at 20% pay cut for better work-life balance*

| Window | Likely Feeling | What it tells us |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| 10 min | Anxious about money | Normal loss aversion |
| 10 months | Grateful for evenings | Lifestyle has changed |
| 10 years | Barely remember the salary | Money was fungible; time wasn't |

**Insight**: The 10-year view reveals this is primarily a lifestyle decision, not a financial one.

### When to Use
- Emotional decisions (relationship changes, big purchases)
- When short-term pain might mask long-term gain
- When caught in analysis paralysis

## Regret Minimization

### Origin
Jeff Bezos used this framework to decide whether to leave his finance job to start Amazon.

### The Mental Exercise

1. Imagine yourself at 80 years old
2. Looking back at your life
3. Ask: "Will I regret doing this?" and "Will I regret NOT doing this?"

### The Asymmetry of Regret

Research shows people regret things they *didn't* do more than things they did:
- Actions: Initial regret fades as we rationalize, learn, or adapt
- Inactions: Regret compounds as we wonder "what if"

### Application Example

*Decision: Leave stable corporate job to start a company*

**At 80, will I regret starting the company?**
- If it fails: "I tried. I learned. I'll never wonder."
- If it succeeds: "Life-defining achievement."

**At 80, will I regret NOT starting?**
- "I always wondered what could have been."
- "I played it safe and got the safe outcome."

**Insight**: For this type of decision, the regret of inaction typically exceeds the regret of failed action.

### Limitations
- Doesn't apply to genuinely irreversible or catastrophic decisions
- Can romanticize risk-taking; consider actual stakes
- Should complement, not replace, rational analysis

## Weighted Decision Matrix

### Structure

| Criterion | Weight (1-10) | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-----------|---------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Factor 1 | 8 | Score 1-10 | Score 1-10 | Score 1-10 |
| Factor 2 | 6 | | | |
| Factor 3 | 9 | | | |
| **Weighted Total** | | Σ(weight×score) | | |

### Process

1. **List criteria**: All factors that matter for this decision
2. **Weight criteria**: How important is each? (1=low, 10=critical)
3. **Score options**: How well does each option perform? (1=poor, 10=excellent)
4. **Calculate**: Multiply weights × scores, sum totals
5. **Sanity check**: Does the winner feel right? If not, examine why.

### Application Example

*Decision: Choose between three job offers*

| Criterion | Weight | Company A | Company B | Company C |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Compensation | 8 | 9 | 6 | 8 |
| Growth opportunity | 9 | 5 | 9 | 7 |
| Work-life balance | 7 | 4 | 7 | 8 |
| Team quality | 8 | 8 | 7 | 6 |
| Mission alignment | 6 | 3 | 8 | 5 |
| **Weighted Total** | | 225 | 281 | 262 |

**Winner**: Company B (despite lower compensation)

### Caveats
- Weights reveal your values — examine them
- Gut disagreement with result is data (what did you miss?)
- Don't over-engineer; 5-7 criteria usually sufficient

## Integration: When to Use What

| Framework | Best For | Key Question |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| First Principles | Evaluating opportunities | Can I solve this myself? |
| Opportunity Cost | Resource allocation | What am I giving up? |
| Scenario Matrix | Risk assessment | What could happen? |
| Pre-Mortem | Risk mitigation | How could this fail? |
| 10-10-10 | Emotional decisions | How will I feel later? |
| Regret Minimization | Life decisions | What will 80-year-old me think? |
| Weighted Matrix | Comparing options | Which scores highest? |

### Combining Frameworks

For major decisions, use multiple frameworks:

1. **First Principles**: Is this worth considering at all?
2. **Opportunity Cost**: Can I afford it?
3. **Scenario Matrix**: What are the likely outcomes?
4. **Pre-Mortem**: How do I mitigate risks?
5. **10-10-10 / Regret**: Does it align with my values?
6. **Final check**: Does the conclusion feel right?
