# Story Generator

This skill generates complete graphic novel narratives about key contributors to various subjects for intelligent textbooks built with MkDocs Material markdown.  The stories are designed to be inspirational, engaging and educational for high school students, with a focus on historical accuracy and compelling storytelling. Each story includes detailed image prompts for AI image generation of each panel, ensuring a visually rich experience that complements the narrative.  Each panel image is followed by a short 3-4 sentence narrative that provides context and emotional depth to the scene depicted, making the story accessible and engaging for high school students.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- The user requests a new graphic novel story about a scientist or physicist
- Adding a story to a Physics History Graphic Novels section
- Creating educational narrative content with image prompts for AI image generation
- The user mentions "story", "graphic novel", or "narrative" about a historical scientist

## Story Structure

Each story follows a consistent structure designed to engage high school students:

### Required Components

1. **YAML Frontmatter** - Title, description, social media image paths
2. **Cover Image** - With detailed generation prompt in `<details>` block
3. **Narrative Prompt** - Background context for generating the story
4. **Prologue** - Hook introducing the scientist's significance
5. **Chapters (12-14)** - Each with narrative text, image placeholder, and image prompt for the panel
6. **Epilogue** - Lessons table summarizing what made the scientist successful
7. **Call to Action** - Inspiring message connecting to readers
8. **Quotes** - 2-3 memorable quotes from the scientist
9. **References** - Academic sources (can use placeholders initially)

A template for the story structure can be found in `skills/story-generator/references/index-template.md`.

### Image Prompt Requirements

Every image prompt must specify:

- Wide-landscape **16:9 format**
- Period-appropriate art style (e.g., "Victorian", "Art Nouveau", "Renaissance")
- Specific scene details and characters
- Color palette guidance
- Emotional tone and mood

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Information and Plan the Story

Before writing, identify:

- The scientist's name and birth/death years
- Key discoveries or contributions
- Central theme (e.g., "overcoming doubters", "persistence through failure")
- Historical period and appropriate art style
- 3-5 key life events that form the narrative arc

### Step 2: Create Story Directory

```bash
mkdir -p docs/stories/<scientist-name>
```

Use lowercase with hyphens for directory names (e.g., `nikola-tesla`, `marie-curie`).

### Step 3: Write the Story

Create `docs/stories/<scientist-name>/index.md` with the following structure:

```markdown
---
title: <Catchy Title> - <Scientist Name>'s <Theme>
description: A graphic-novel story of how <brief description>...
image: /stories/<scientist-name>/cover.png
og:image: /stories/<scientist-name>/cover.png
twitter:image: /stories/<scientist-name>/cover.png
social:
   cards: false
---

# <Catchy Title>: <Subtitle>

![Cover image](./cover.png)
<details>
<summary>Cover Image Prompt</summary>
[Detailed cover image generation prompt - 16:9 format, period style, composition details.
Include specific characters, setting, color palette, and emotional tone.]
</details>

<details>
<summary>Narrative Prompt</summary>
[Background context and style guide for the entire story]
</details>

### Prologue – <Hook Title>

[Opening narrative establishing the scientist's importance]

![](./panel-01.png)
<details><summary>Image Prompt</summary>
Please generate a 16:9 image in [period style] depicting the the first panel. The scene should include [specific characters], set in [specific setting including period in time and location], with a color palette of [color palette]. The emotional tone should be [emotional tone].
[Detailed image prompt for prologue scene with a minimum of 6 specific details to guide the AI image generation.]
</details>

## Panel N – <Panel Title>

![](./panel-N.png)
<details><summary>Image Prompt</summary>
Please generate a 16:9 image in [period style] depicting the panel N. The scene should include [specific characters], set in [specific setting including period in time and location], with a color palette of [color palette]. The emotional tone should be [emotional tone].
[Detailed image prompt for prologue scene with a minimum of 6 specific details to guide the AI image generation.]
</details>

[Panel narrative text which is 3-4 sentences long.  This is the text that will appear in the graphic novel panel.  It should be engaging and move the story forward, while also being historically accurate and appropriate for high school students.  The narrative should be written in a way that complements the image, providing context and emotional depth to the scene depicted.  Use active voice and vivid descriptions to bring the story to life, while also ensuring that the language is accessible to the target audience.]

[Continue for 12-14 chapters...]

### Epilogue – What Made <Scientist> Different?

[Summary of lessons learned]

| Challenge | How <Scientist> Responded | Lesson for Today |
|-----------|---------------------------|------------------|
| ... | ... | ... |

### Call to Action

[Inspiring message connecting to readers]

---

*"Quote from scientist"*
—<Scientist Name>

---

## References

1. [Title](PLACEHOLDER) - Description
[Continue with 4-6 references]
```

**Important:** Always use `.png` extension for image references (not `.jpg`).

### Step 4: Add to Navigation

Edit `mkdocs.yml` to add the story in **chronological order by birth year**:

```yaml
- Stories:
    - Overview: stories/index.md
    - <Scientist Name> - <Title>: stories/<scientist-name>/index.md
```

Reference chronological order:
- Archimedes (287 BC)
- Galileo (1564)
- Newton (1643)
- Faraday (1791)
- Tesla (1856)
- Marie Curie (1867)
- Rutherford (1871)
- Lise Meitner (1878)
- Einstein (1879)
- Chien-Shiung Wu (1912)
- Vera Rubin (1928)

### Step 5: Add Grid Card to Stories Index

Edit `docs/stories/index.md` to add a card using MkDocs Material grid format:

```markdown
- **[<Story Title>](<scientist-name>/index.md)**

    ![<Scientist Name>](./<scientist-name>/cover.png)
    <2-4 sentence compelling description emphasizing the story's theme>
```

## Writing Guidelines

### Target Audience

- High school students (grades 9-12)
- Age 14-18

- Show struggles, failures, and persistence
- Connect historical events to modern technology

### Theme Development

Choose a central theme that resonates with teenagers:

- Staying humble despite success

### Historical Accuracy

- Research key dates, events, and relationships
