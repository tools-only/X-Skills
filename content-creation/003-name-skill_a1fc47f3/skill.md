# Skill Repair

Audit and improve an existing skill against a gold standard. Unlike create-skill (which
generates from scratch), this skill diagnoses violations *and* identifies gaps — what is
broken, what is missing, and what would raise quality. The output is a structured
improvement plan covering all dimensions.

## Phase 1: Load the Skill

Read `$ARGUMENTS` as the path to a skill directory or SKILL.md file.

- If a directory: read `SKILL.md`, then list and note which of `references/`, `examples/`,
  `scripts/`, `assets/` exist and which are referenced from SKILL.md
- If a file: read it directly, then discover sibling resource directories

If the path is missing or ambiguous, use AskUserQuestion to resolve before proceeding.

**Load both reference files before Phase 2:**

1. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/repair-skill/references/skill-anatomy.md` — gold standard for
   correct anatomy, three-level loading model, directory type definitions, degrees of
   freedom, naming conventions, body conventions. Required for Dimensions 5, 6, and 7.
2. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/repair-skill/references/frontmatter-options.md` — complete
   frontmatter field catalog, valid values, tool list, tool selection framework.
   Required for Dimensions 1 and 2.

Proceed to Phase 2 when: SKILL.md is read, sibling directories are cataloged, and both
reference files are loaded.

## Phase 2: Audit

Run each dimension independently. For each finding record: the dimension code, what is
wrong or missing, which principle it violates or which gold standard it falls short of,
and the specific change required. Proceed to Phase 3 when all 7 dimensions are evaluated.

**Finding types:**
- **Violation** — something present that contradicts a rule
- **Gap** — something absent that would improve the skill against the gold standard
- **Improvement** — something that works but could be meaningfully tightened

**Severity:**
- **critical** — breaks triggering or wastes significant context on every invocation
- **major** — degrades generalization, reliability, or workflow correctness
- **minor** — polish; the skill works but isn't as good as it could be

---

### Dimension 1 — Frontmatter Quality

The description is the only part of a skill that is always in context. Every token here
costs budget across every session. Audit for violations *and* gaps:

**Violations:**
- **Person and framing:** Is the description third-person ("This skill should be used
  when...")? First-person or imperative framing reads as an instruction to execute, not a
  triggering condition to evaluate. *Critical if wrong.*
- **Scalar type:** Does the description use `>` (folded scalar)? The `|` literal scalar
  preserves newlines and can produce unexpected whitespace when parsed. *Minor.*
- **Trigger phrase authenticity:** Are quoted phrases verbatim user speech — the exact
  tokens a user would type? Paraphrases ("hook creation tasks") have lower routing match
  rates than natural language ("create a hook"). *Major if paraphrased.*
- **Token density:** Does the description restate the skill name, explain what skills are,
  or include meta-commentary? Every such token is budget waste. *Minor per instance,
  major if systemic.*

**Gaps:**
- **Trigger phrase coverage:** Are there 3–5+ varied phrases? Single-phrase descriptions
  miss synonym space. Does coverage include the naive phrasing a user would use who has
  never heard of this skill? *Major if sparse.*
- **Missing `argument-hint`:** Does the skill read `$ARGUMENTS` or `$1`/$`$2` without an
  `argument-hint` field? The hint is shown in autocomplete — its absence means users don't
  know what to pass. *Minor.*
- **Name validity:** Is the skill name lowercase, hyphens only, max 64 chars? Verb-led for
  commands? Namespaced when it aids routing clarity? These constraints ensure filesystem
  compatibility, command-line ergonomics, and unambiguous routing. *Minor if wrong.*

---

### Dimension 2 — Execution Modifiers

Modifiers left at their defaults are not errors — omitting them is correct when defaults
apply. Audit for *mismatches* (violations) and *missing configuration* (gaps).

Refer to `frontmatter-options.md` for the complete field catalog, model selection table,
and tool selection framework.

**Violations:**
- Is `model: opus` set for a task that `sonnet` would handle? Overuse wastes cost.
- Does the skill have unrestricted `Bash` when a scoped pattern (`Bash(git:*)`) would work?
- Does the skill have tools in `allowed-tools` it never uses? Dead entries add noise.
- Is `context: fork` set without `agent:`, or `agent:` set without `context: fork`?

**Gaps:**
- Does the skill do heavy analysis that would benefit from `model: opus`?
- Does the skill produce heavy output that would pollute main context — missing `context: fork`?
- Does the skill invoke other skills or spawn agents without `Skill` or `Task` in `allowed-tools`?
- Does the skill require user decisions mid-workflow but lacks `AskUserQuestion` in `allowed-tools`?
- Does the skill read a file path from `$1` but uses a `Read` tool call instead of `@$1`
  inline injection? A tool round-trip is being wasted. *Minor.*
- Could real-time data (git status, env vars, file tree) be injected using dynamic content
  syntax (bang + backtick-wrapped command) instead of a tool call? *Minor per instance.*

---

### Dimension 3 — Intensional vs Extensional Instruction

A rule stated with its reasoning generalizes to every input. An example that implies a
rule requires the reading model to reverse-engineer the rule — two reasoning hops instead
of one, covering only the shape of that example.

**Violations:**
- Does it show a good/bad contrast and leave the principle implicit? The principle should
  be stated first; the contrast confirms it, not carries it.
- Is a "Common Mistakes" or "Bad/Good examples" section doing the work that a single
  principle sentence could do more efficiently? *Major.*
- Would removing the examples leave the rule intact and still actionable? If yes, the
  examples are redundant. If no, the rule hasn't been stated yet — state it.

**Gaps:**
- Are there instruction blocks that tell Claude *what* to do but not *why*? Adding the
  reasoning makes the instruction generalize to edge cases not covered by the current
  examples. *Major per uncovered block.*

---

### Dimension 4 — Agentic vs Deterministic Split

**Load `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/repair-skill/references/script-patterns.md` before auditing this dimension.** It contains
the five signal patterns for recognizing a script candidate, CLI design conventions,
common archetypes (init, validate, transform, package, query), and the delegation
pattern for using `create-cli` to design the interface.

Skills mix LLM-guided reasoning (agentic) and script execution (deterministic). The split
should be deliberate — see the Degrees of Freedom table in `skill-anatomy.md`.

**Violations:**
- **Code blocks that are repeated or identical across invocations** — these are
  deterministic operations being re-generated each time. They belong in `scripts/`.
  Inlining costs context tokens on every run; scripts execute without being loaded.
- **Prose that describes a deterministic sequence** — if the steps are always the same
  regardless of input, a script is more reliable than asking the model to reproduce them.
- **Scripts that exist but aren't referenced in SKILL.md** — Claude won't use them.
  A script without a reference in SKILL.md specifying when and how to invoke it is
  invisible to the skill workflow. *Major.*
- **Vague script references** — "run the validation script if needed" is not actionable.
  References must state the trigger condition, the exact invocation, and how to interpret
  the output. *Minor.*

**Gaps — apply the five signal patterns from `script-patterns.md` to each workflow step:**
- **Signal 1 (Repeated Generation):** Does any step produce the same structure with
  different parameters across invocations? → Parameterized script candidate. *Major.*
- **Signal 2 (Unclear Tool Choice):** Does any step require combining multiple standard
  tools in a fragile sequence to accomplish something naturally expressible as a single
  function? → Script the procedure. *Major.*
- **Signal 3 (Rigid Contract):** Does any step have an input/output shape clear enough
  to write `--help` text for right now? → CLI candidate; delegate design to `create-cli`.
- **Signal 4 (Dual-Use Potential):** Would any step be useful to run independently from
  the terminal, outside the skill workflow? → Design as proper CLI from the start.
- **Signal 5 (Consistency Critical):** Does any step need to produce identical output
  for identical inputs — not "similar" but reproducible? → Script, not LLM generation.
- **Judgment steps with no criteria** — "analyze the situation" is agentic but unanchored.
  Agentic steps need explicit criteria for what to consider and what constitutes a good
  outcome. *Major per uncovered step.*

---

### Dimension 5 — Verbosity and Context Efficiency

Every token in SKILL.md is loaded into context when the skill triggers. Audit for tokens
that consume budget without improving outcomes, *and* for content that belongs in
`references/` instead.

Refer to the size invariants table in `skill-anatomy.md` to calibrate severity.

**Violations:**
- **Prose that restates the section header** — "## Validation" followed by "In this
  section we will validate..." is pure redundancy. *Minor per instance.*
- **Hedging language** — "you might want to consider", "it could be useful to",
  "generally speaking". Replace with direct imperatives or remove. *Minor per instance.*
- **Code blocks illustrating a principle stateable in one sentence** — a good/bad YAML
  contrast often collapses to one intensional rule. *Major if pattern is frequent.*
- **Repeated guidance across sections** — the same rule in a "Best Practices" section and
  a "Common Mistakes" section. Consolidate to one location. *Minor.*
- **"When to Use This Skill" section in the body** — body loads only after triggering;
  routing guidance here is never read by the routing decision. Dead tokens every invocation.
  *Major.*
- **Headers deeper than H3** — signals content that belongs in `references/`. *Minor.*
- **SKILL.md over ~500 lines** — requires `references/` deferral. *Major.*
- **Extraneous documentation files** (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `INSTALLATION.md`) in
  the skill directory — never loaded into context, add noise to the package. *Minor per file.*

**Gaps:**
- **Would a `references/` file reduce SKILL.md size?** Identify sections only needed for
  specific sub-tasks and flag them as deferral candidates. *Major if SKILL.md > 300 lines.*
- **Would a `references/` file for domain-specific data help?** Lookup tables, option
  catalogs, field definitions — these are reference data, not instructions. *Major.*

---

### Dimension 6 — Workflow Clarity

A skill's process should be sequential, complete, and have explicit exit conditions at
each phase. Audit for broken workflow *and* for missing structure that would help.

**Violations:**
- Is the process structured as numbered phases with clear names? Without explicit phases
  the model can't track progress or know which step it's in. *Major if unstructured.*
- Does each phase have an explicit exit condition? Without one, the model doesn't know
  when to stop iterating on a phase and may loop or skip prematurely. *Major if missing.*
- Are there half-thought steps — phases that describe intent without specifying what to
  do or how to evaluate the result? *Major per uncovered phase.*
- Does the skill handle missing, ambiguous, or malformed input?

**Gaps:**
- Is there a delivery phase that tells Claude what to produce and in what format? Many
  skills describe the process clearly but leave the output format implicit. *Major if absent.*
- Would a validation checklist at the end of the workflow catch errors that prose
  instructions miss? *Minor.*
- Would an `examples/` directory help users understand what the expected output looks
  like? *Minor.*

---

### Dimension 7 — Anatomy Completeness

Refer to `skill-anatomy.md` for the gold standard directory anatomy and the Gap Analysis
Checklist. This dimension asks: does the skill's structure match its complexity tier, and
what is absent that would raise it?

**Use the Gap Analysis Checklist from `skill-anatomy.md` directly.** For each "yes"
answer, record a gap at the appropriate severity.

**Violations:**
- Does the skill have a `scripts/` directory with scripts not referenced in SKILL.md?
  *Major — referenced or delete.*
- Does the skill have a `references/` directory with files not pointed to from SKILL.md?
  *Major — referenced or delete.*
- Does the naming violate conventions (uppercase, underscores, over 64 chars)? *Minor.*

**Gaps — ask for each absent directory:**
- **Missing `scripts/`:** Is there a deterministic operation that would be more reliable
  scripted? Does the same code block appear or would it appear in multiple invocations?
- **Missing `references/`:** Does SKILL.md exceed 300 lines? Are there sections only
  needed for specific sub-tasks? Is there domain-specific reference data?
- **Missing `examples/`:** Does the skill produce output users adapt? Are there ambiguous
  instructions a working example would clarify better than prose?
- **Missing resource pointers in SKILL.md:** Are there directories present but not
  referenced — invisible to Claude unless it guesses to look?

---

## Phase 3: Improvement Report

Present findings as a structured report. Split violations from gaps — a violation is
something wrong, a gap is something missing that would improve the skill.

```
SKILL IMPROVEMENT REPORT: <skill-name>
Current tier: [simple / standard / complex] — [lines] lines, [directories present]

VIOLATIONS
──────────
CRITICAL
  [D1] Description uses first-person — routing model reads as instruction, not trigger.
       Fix: rewrite as "This skill should be used when the user asks to..."

MAJOR
  [D3] Body teaches frontmatter quality by bad/good contrast; principle never stated.
       Fix: state the rule ("quoted phrases must be verbatim user speech because routing
       matches on literal tokens") then keep the contrast as confirmation.
  [D5] "When to Use This Skill" section in body — dead tokens every invocation.
       Fix: move routing guidance to frontmatter description, delete body section.

MINOR
  [D1] Description uses | scalar instead of >.
       Fix: change to >.

GAPS (what would improve this skill)
─────────────────────────────────────
MAJOR
  [D7] SKILL.md is 420 lines with no references/ directory. Three sections (option catalog,
       field definitions, examples table) are only needed for specific sub-tasks.
       Improvement: extract to references/; add load pointer in SKILL.md for each.
  [D4] File-path validation logic is inlined but must produce consistent output.
       Improvement: move to scripts/validate-input.py; reference from Phase 2.

MINOR
  [D2] Skill reads $1 as a file path but uses Read tool — @$1 injection would save a
       tool round-trip.
       Improvement: replace Read call with @$1 inline injection.
  [D7] No examples/ directory; skill produces config output users adapt.
       Improvement: add examples/ with one representative output file.
```

Group violations by severity, then gaps by severity. For each: dimension code, what is
wrong or missing, the principle or gold standard it falls short of, the exact fix.

Ask: "Apply all critical and major items? Or select specific ones?"

---

## Phase 4: Apply Improvements

Apply confirmed items in order: critical violations → major violations → major gaps →
minor violations → minor gaps.

For each item:
- State what is being changed or added and why (principle reference, not just "you asked")
- Make the edit or create the file
- Confirm the change is consistent with surrounding content

### Explain Your Choices

After applying improvements, briefly explain:
- **What was changed and why** — reference the principle: "Rewrote description as
  third-person because first-person framing is parsed as an instruction to execute, not a
  triggering condition to evaluate"
- **What was added and why** — "Created references/options.md and deferred the option
  catalog because SKILL.md was 420 lines and the catalog is only needed for the
  configuration sub-task"
- **What was left unchanged and why** — "Left `model` unset — workload doesn't justify
  overriding the default"
- **What remains for the user to address** — "The examples/ gap requires domain knowledge
  to fill; a placeholder directory was created"

Phase 4 is complete when all confirmed items are applied, the explanation is delivered,
and the validation checklist passes.

---

## Validation

After applying all improvements, load `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/repair-skill/references/quality-checklist.md`
and run the quality standards check followed by the item-by-item validation checklist.
Report any failing items before delivering final results.
