# SEO Content: Content Optimization

Guides on-page content optimization: word count, heading keywords, keyword density vs stuffing, multimedia, tables, and lists. Complements **seo-on-page-heading** (structure) and **seo-content-content-strategy** (planning).

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Scope

- **Word count**: Length by content type; quality over length
- **H2 keywords**: Placement, quantity, variation
- **Keyword density vs stuffing**: Natural use; avoid manipulation
- **Multimedia**: Images, tables, lists for structure and Featured Snippets

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for target keywords and content type.

Identify:
1. **Content type**: Article, guide, listicle, pillar, news
2. **Target keyword**: Primary and secondary
3. **Competitors**: Top 10 average length and structure

---

## Word Count

**Google does not rank by word count.** Length should match search intent and topic depth. A 1,000-word post that satisfies intent can outrank a 3,000-word thin piece.

### Reference Ranges by Content Type

| Content type | Word count | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| **News / announcements** | 300–600 | Time-sensitive; concise |
| **Standard articles / how-tos** | 1,000–1,500 | Single topic; actionable |
| **Listicles / guides** | 1,200–2,000 | "Top 10," "Best X" |
| **Pillar / cornerstone** | 2,000–3,500+ | Comprehensive; cluster hub |
| **Competitive keywords** | 2,000–2,500 | Top 10 avg ~2,400 words |

### Strategy

1. **Analyze top 10** for target keyword — average length and depth
2. **Match intent** — informational often needs ~40% longer than transactional
3. **Value over padding** — each section must add genuine value; avoid fluff
4. **Comprehensive coverage** — answer the query and related questions

## H2 Heading Keywords

### Placement

- **Primary keyword**: Include naturally in at least one H2 when relevant
- **Related keywords**: Use LSI and long-tail in other H2s for topical coverage
- **Avoid stuffing**: Headings must stay clear and readable; organic placement only

### Quantity

- **No strict limit** — one H2 per major section; structure follows content
- **Typical article**: 4–8 H2s; pillar: 8–15+ H2s
- **Hierarchy**: H1 → H2 (major sections) → H3 (subsections); don't skip levels

### Best Practices

| Practice | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Descriptive H2s** | Search engines understand context; users scan |
| **Answer-first** | Place direct answer in first 40–50 words after H2 for Featured Snippets |
| **Keyword variation** | Use related terms; avoid repeating exact phrase in every H2 |
| **Logical flow** | H2s outline the article; support topical authority |

## Keyword Density vs Keyword Stuffing

### Definitions

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Keyword density** | (Keyword count / Total words) × 100; a metric, not a ranking factor |
| **Keyword stuffing** | Excessive, unnatural repetition to manipulate rankings; black-hat |

### Current Guidance

- **Keyword density is not a direct ranking factor** — Google has stated since 2011 that repetition alone doesn't improve rankings
- **Reference range**: 0.5%–1.5% for most content; some sources cite up to 2.5%
- **Use density mainly to avoid stuffing** — if density exceeds ~2–3% and reads unnaturally, reduce
- **Prioritize natural placement**: title, H1, first 100 words, 1–2 H2s, body; avoid forced repetition

### How to Avoid Stuffing

- Write for users first; keywords should fit naturally
- Use synonyms, related terms, and question phrasing
- If a sentence sounds awkward with the keyword, rewrite
- Monitor: if every paragraph repeats the exact phrase, simplify

## Multimedia: Images, Tables, Lists

### Images

| Practice | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Alt text** | Descriptive; include keyword when natural; accessibility |
| **File names** | Descriptive (e.g. `seo-checklist-2025.jpg`) |
| **Compression** | WebP; optimize for LCP |
| **Captions** | Relevant to topic; can support Featured Snippets |
| **Original over stock** | Unique images signal E-E-A-T |

### Tables

- **Use for**: Comparisons, stats, specs, "X vs Y"
- **Semantic HTML**: `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, clear column headers
- **Featured Snippets**: ~6% of snippets are tables; optimize headers with target keywords
- **Mobile**: Responsive; avoid horizontal scroll when possible
- **Data quality**: No empty cells; consistent units; accurate, current data

### Lists: Ordered vs Unordered

| Type | Use case | SEO / Snippet |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Ordered (`<ol>`)** | Steps, rankings, sequences, "Top 10" | List snippets (~19% of Featured Snippets); how-to |
| **Unordered (`<ul>`)** | Non-sequential items, features, options | Bullet snippets; definitions, options |

**Best practices**:
- Use semantic `<ol>` and `<ul>`; avoid divs styled as lists
- **Answer-first**: For snippet targets, put the direct answer in the first 40–50 words after the heading
- **Concise items**: List items should be scannable; expand in body if needed
- **Logical order**: Ordered lists = sequence matters; unordered = no sequence

### GEO / AI Citation

- **Answer-first**: Direct answer in first 40–60 words after H2; increases AI citation ~35%
- **TL;DR or Key Takeaways**: Choose one — 50–100 word summary *or* 5–7 bullet points; supports GEO
- **QAE pattern**: Question (H2) → Answer (2 sentences) → Evidence (data, lists, examples)
- See **pages-article** for full GEO section; **strategies-geo** for GEO strategy

### Featured Snippet Formats

| Format | Share | Use |
|--------|-------|-----|
| **Paragraph** | ~70% | 40–50 words; direct answer after H2 |
| **List** | ~19% | `<ol>` or `<ul>`; how-to, steps, options |
| **Table** | ~6% | Comparisons, stats, specs |
