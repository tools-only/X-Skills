# Prompt Formats: JSON vs Natural Language

Guide for choosing between structured JSON prompts and natural language descriptions.

## Overview

As of 2025, over 78% of professional AI image creators use structured formats for production work.

| Format | Adoption | Best Use Case |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Natural Language** | Exploration, creative | One-off images, emotional scenes |
| **JSON Structured** | Production, batch | Repeatable results, precise control |

---

## Natural Language Prompts

### When to Use
- Creative exploration and rapid iteration
- When you're still discovering what you want
- Emotional, atmospheric, storytelling images
- One-off creative pieces

### Strengths
- Full flexibility of human expression
- Nuanced emotional and contextual cues
- More evocative, artistic results
- Easier for beginners

### Weaknesses
- Less consistent results
- Harder to reproduce exactly
- Ambiguity can lead to unexpected outputs

### Example
```
A lone samurai stands at the edge of a misty cliff at dawn. Cherry blossoms
drift past as golden light breaks through storm clouds. His weathered armor
tells stories of countless battles. Shot from below to emphasize his imposing
presence, with dramatic rim lighting. Cinematic Kurosawa-inspired composition
with deep shadows and atmospheric fog.
```

## JSON Structured Prompts

### When to Use
- Production work requiring consistency
- Batch generation of similar images
- When precise control over specific elements is needed
- Templates for repeated use
- Team collaboration (clear specifications)

### Strengths
- Highly repeatable and consistent
- Machine-friendly, easy to template
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to modify specific elements
- Better for documentation

### Weaknesses
- Less creative freedom
- Can feel rigid for artistic work
- Requires understanding of structure
- Small errors can have outsized effects

### Example
```json
{
  "subject": {
    "type": "samurai warrior",
    "pose": "standing at cliff edge",
    "details": "weathered armor, battle-worn",
    "expression": "contemplative, stoic"
  },
  "environment": {
    "location": "cliff edge",
    "time": "dawn",
    "weather": "misty, storm clouds breaking",
    "elements": ["cherry blossoms drifting", "golden light rays"]
  },
  "camera": {
    "angle": "low angle, looking up",
    "lens": "35mm",
    "depth_of_field": "deep focus"
  },
  "lighting": {
    "key": "golden hour from behind clouds",
    "fill": "ambient fog diffusion",
    "accent": "dramatic rim light"
  },
  "style": {
    "reference": "Akira Kurosawa cinematography",
    "mood": "epic, contemplative",
    "color_palette": "muted earth tones with golden highlights"
  }
}
```

## Hybrid Approach

For best results, consider:

1. **Start with Natural Language** for creative exploration
2. **Convert to JSON** once you find a style you like
3. **Use JSON templates** for production variations
4. **Add natural language descriptions** within JSON for nuanced elements

### Hybrid Example
```json
{
  "core_concept": "A lone samurai at dawn - epic, contemplative, Kurosawa-inspired",
  "subject": "samurai warrior, weathered armor, standing at cliff edge",
  "environment": "misty cliff, cherry blossoms, storm clouds breaking",
  "camera": "low angle, 35mm, deep focus",
  "lighting": "golden hour rim light, fog diffusion",
  "style": "cinematic, muted earth tones with golden highlights",
  "mood_notes": "Should feel like the calm before a final battle - peaceful yet charged with tension"
}
```

## Model-Specific Notes

| Model | Recommended Format | Why |
|-------|-------------------|-----|
| **Grok Imagine** | **Natural language** | FLUX.1 architecture — trained on natural descriptions, not tags |
| **Z-Image / FLUX** | **Natural language** | Same FLUX.1 base — natural language > keyword stacking |
| **Qwen Image** | **Natural language** | LLM-based — understands paragraphs better than tags |
| **Nano Banana Pro** | Either | Handles both well |
| **Sora 2 / Wan 2.2** | **Natural language** | Video models need scene descriptions, not keyword lists |
| **Stable Diffusion (old)** | Keywords/tags | Older UNet models trained on tag-style prompts |
| **Midjourney** | Natural language + params | Natural with `--ar`, `--style` flags |

### 2026 Trend: Natural Language เป็น Default

Model รุ่นใหม่ (FLUX, Qwen, Grok) ทั้งหมดชอบ natural language:
- เขียนเหมือน **บรรยายฉากให้ช่างภาพฟัง** ไม่ใช่ tag รูป
- ระบุ camera/lens เป็น context ("shot on Hasselblad X2D") ไม่ใช่ keyword
- อธิบาย emotion/story เป็นประโยค ไม่ใช่ comma-separated adjectives
- **Keyword stacking ใช้เฉพาะ** Stable Diffusion 1.5/XL หรือ ComfyUI ที่ใช้ CLIP encoder เก่า

## Quick Decision Guide

```
Is this for production/batch work?
├─ YES → Use JSON
└─ NO
    └─ Is precise control critical?
        ├─ YES → Use JSON
        └─ NO
            └─ Is this creative exploration?
                ├─ YES → Use Natural Language
                └─ NO → Either works, prefer Natural Language
```
