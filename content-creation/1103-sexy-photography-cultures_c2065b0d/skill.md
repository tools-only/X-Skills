## Part 2: Boudoir Photography

**Natural Light (Preferred):**
```

- Creates soft, intimate mood
- Gold/white reflector to fill shadows
- Overcast light = most flattering
```

**Corrective Lighting Principles:**
```

- Light the SHORTEST side of face (short lighting)
- Eyes drawn to brightest area
- Keep main light + edge light on SAME side
```

**Three-Point Setup:**
```
