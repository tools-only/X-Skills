## Overview

Google's engineering blog post describes the context engineering architecture behind the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**, an open-source Python framework for building production-grade multi-agent systems. The article introduces "context engineering" — treating context as a first-class system with its own architecture, lifecycle, and constraints — as the key discipline required to scale agents beyond prototypes. ADK implements this discipline through a tiered storage model, a compiler-style pipeline, and explicit multi-agent handoff semantics.

## Problem Addressed

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Naive "append everything" context strategy causes cost/latency spirals | Tiered storage model separates durable state from per-call working context |
| Signal degradation ("lost in the middle") from irrelevant context | Explicit processor pipeline filters and compacts before reaching the model |
| Fixed context windows overflow for long-running agents | Async context compaction summarizes older events and prunes raw history |
| Context coupling to model API format prevents portability | Session stores typed Events; working context is a derived, model-agnostic view |
| Large data payloads permanently bloat conversation history | Artifact handle pattern externalizes large objects; loaded on demand only |
| Sub-agents inherit full ancestor history causing context explosion | Scoped handoffs via `include_contents` knob; sub-agents see minimum needed |
| Role ambiguity when agent A's outputs look like agent B's own history | Narrative casting and action attribution during handoff reframe prior turns |
| Memory-less agents repeat past mistakes across sessions | Long-term `MemoryService` with reactive and proactive recall patterns |
| Cache invalidation from unstable context prefixes | `static_instruction` primitive guarantees immutable prefix for prefix caching |

## Key Features

### 1. Tiered Context Model

ADK organizes context into four distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility:

- **Working Context** — ephemeral per-call prompt: system instructions, selected history, tool outputs, memory results, artifact references
- **Session** — durable log of all interactions as strongly-typed `Event` objects (user messages, agent replies, tool calls, tool results, control signals, errors)
- **Memory** — long-lived, searchable knowledge persisting across sessions (user preferences, past decisions, domain facts) via `MemoryService`
- **Artifacts** — large binary or text objects (files, CSVs, PDFs) stored by name/version via `ArtifactService`; never pasted into the prompt by default

### 2. Context as a Compiled View

Core design thesis: context is not a mutable string buffer but a **compiled view over stateful storage**:

- Sessions and Memory are the *sources* — full structured state
- LLM Flows with ordered Processors are the *compiler pipeline*
- Working Context is the *compiled output* — ephemeral, configurable, model-agnostic

This separation allows storage schemas and prompt formats to evolve independently.

### 3. LLM Flow Processor Pipeline

Every LLM-backed agent uses a named, ordered processor list to build Working Context:

- **`instructions` processor** — injects system instructions and agent identity
- **`contents` processor** — transforms Session Events into model-ready history (select → transform → inject)
- **`memory` processor** — optionally attaches retrieved memory snippets
- **`artifacts` processor** — injects lightweight artifact references (not raw data)
- Custom processors can be inserted for filtering, compaction, caching, and routing

### 4. Context Compaction and Filtering

- **Compaction**: When a configurable invocation threshold is reached, an async process uses an LLM to summarize older events over a sliding window and writes the summary back as a new `compaction` Event. Raw events are then pruned/de-prioritized.
- **Filtering**: Deterministic rule-based plugins that globally drop or trim context before it reaches the model.
- Benefits: sessions remain physically manageable; the `contents` processor works over already-compacted history; compaction strategies are tunable without touching agent code.

### 5. Context Caching (Prefix Caching)

- ADK's storage/view separation creates natural stable prefixes (system instructions, agent identity, long-lived summaries) and variable suffixes (latest user turn, new tool outputs).
- `static_instruction` primitive guarantees immutability for system prompts, keeping cache prefixes valid across invocations.
- Processor ordering can be designed explicitly for cache-friendliness.

### 6. Artifact Handle Pattern

- Large payloads live in `ArtifactService`, not the prompt.
- Agents see only a lightweight reference (name + summary) by default via the request processor.
- `LoadArtifactsTool` loads raw data into Working Context on demand; data is offloaded after the call (ephemeral expansion).
- Turns "5MB of noise in every prompt" into a precise, on-demand resource.

### 7. Memory Service

- `MemoryService` ingests data from finished Sessions into a vector/keyword corpus.
- **Reactive recall**: Agent explicitly calls `load_memory_tool` when it recognizes a knowledge gap.
- **Proactive recall**: Pre-processor runs similarity search on latest user input and injects likely-relevant snippets via `preload_memory_tool` before model invocation.

### 8. Multi-Agent Context Scoping

Two interaction patterns:

- **Agents as Tools**: Caller treats sub-agent as a function — sub-agent sees only focused prompt and specific artifacts, no history.
- **Agent Transfer (Hierarchy)**: Full handoff; sub-agent inherits a *scoped* view of the Session and can drive the workflow.

Scoping is controlled by `include_contents` on the callee: `full` (default), `none` (new prompt only), or custom selection.

### 9. Narrative Casting for Agent Handoffs

When transferring control between agents, ADK actively reframes conversation context:

- Prior "Assistant" messages from the upstream agent are re-cast as narrative context (e.g., tagged as `[For context]: Agent B said...`) to prevent the new agent from misattributing those actions to itself.
- Tool calls from other agents are marked/summarized so the new agent acts on results without confusing execution with its own capabilities.

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

### Applications

- **Context budget management**: The tiered storage / compiled view pattern directly applies to Claude Code agent design — separate what is stored from what the model sees each turn.
- **Multi-agent handoff discipline**: The `include_contents` scoping and narrative casting principles apply to Claude Code Task tool delegation; sub-agents should receive minimal, purpose-built context, not full ancestor history.
- **Artifact handle pattern**: Large files or tool outputs should be referenced by name and loaded on demand, not passed inline in every prompt. Directly applicable to skills that process large codebases or documents.
- **Processor pipeline design**: LLM Flows' ordered processor model mirrors how Claude Code skills chain prompt-building steps; explicit ordering enables testability and cache-friendliness.

### Patterns Worth Adopting

- **Static instructions for cache stability**: Keeping system prompts immutable across invocations (equivalent of `static_instruction`) maximizes prefix cache hits in Claude API calls.
- **Proactive memory recall pre-processor**: Before invoking Claude, run a similarity search against prior session summaries and inject relevant snippets — analogous to our skill's context pre-loading patterns.
- **Compaction strategy**: For long-running Claude Code sessions, periodically summarize older tool results and chat history into a compact summary event rather than appending indefinitely.
- **Narrative casting on handoff**: When chaining agents via Task tool, reframe upstream agent outputs as context annotations (`[Context from previous agent]: ...`) rather than passing them as raw `assistant` role messages.
- **Scope by default**: New agent spawns in Claude Code should receive only the minimum context needed; additional context should require explicit tool calls or prompt arguments.

### Integration Opportunities

- **Research-curator skill**: Apply the artifact handle pattern — store large research documents as artifacts and load on demand rather than embedding in the prompt.
- **Orchestrating-swarms skill**: ADK's two interaction patterns (Agents as Tools vs. Agent Transfer) map directly to Claude Code's Task tool invocation vs. full agent handoff; document which to use when.
- **Session historian skill**: Implement proactive recall by running similarity search on prior session summaries before generating responses.
- **Context engineering guide**: Create a new skill or reference doc documenting Claude Code–specific context engineering patterns derived from ADK's architecture.
