The model MUST write frontmatter descriptions following these rules.

## Formatting Rules

1. **Single-line only** - Never use YAML multiline indicators (`>-`, `|-`, `>`, `|`)
2. **No colons** - Avoid colons (`:`) as they trigger YAML quoting. Swap it for something else or rephrase.
3. **Front-load critical info** - First 1024 characters are most important
   - Claude Code may truncate to 1024 chars in some contexts
   - No hard limit, but keep key information in first 1024 chars
   - Convey purpose, triggers, and value early

A description should be a complete and informative explanation of what the skill does and when to use it. Include WHEN to use this skill - specific scenarios, file types, or tasks that trigger it.

## Validation

After writing, validate with the validation script `plugin_validator.py`

```sh
 plugin_validator.py [file]
```
