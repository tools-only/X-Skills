## Model Cost Guide

### Per-Token Pricing

| Model | Input | Output | Cache Read | Ideal For |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Haiku** | $1.00/MTok | $5.00/MTok | $0.10/MTok | High-volume batch work, quick captures, triage scoring |
| **Sonnet** | $3.00/MTok | $15.00/MTok | $0.30/MTok | Analysis, synthesis, scoring — most skill work |
| **Opus** | $15.00/MTok | $75.00/MTok | $1.50/MTok | Deep architectural reasoning, extended thinking |

### Cost per Typical Operation

| Operation | Model | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Est. Cost |
|-----------|-------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Tag 1 note | Haiku | ~3k | ~500 | $0.006 |
| Tag 100 notes (5 batch agents) | Haiku | ~150k | ~25k | $0.28 |
| Summarise 1 note | Sonnet | ~5k | ~1k | $0.03 |
| Quality report (50 notes, 5 agents) | Sonnet | ~500k | ~100k | $3.00 |
| Impact analysis (4 agents) | Sonnet | ~200k | ~60k | $1.50 |
| Score document (4 agents) | Sonnet | ~300k | ~80k | $2.10 |
| Triage 20 videos (Haiku) + deep 4 (Sonnet) | Mixed | ~260k | ~50k | $1.31 |

### When to Use Each Model

| Criterion | Use Haiku | Use Sonnet | Use Opus |
|-----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Task complexity** | Simple, repetitive | Analytical, comparative | Deep reasoning |
| **Input volume** | 50+ items | 1-50 items | 1-5 items |
| **Reasoning needed** | Pattern matching | Weighing trade-offs | Extended thinking |
| **Cost sensitivity** | High (batch work) | Moderate | Low (quality matters most) |
| **Speed priority** | Fastest response | Balanced | Quality over speed |
| **Skills (coordinator)** | `/weblink`, `/article`, `/email-capture`, `/auto-tag`, `/auto-summary`, `/link-checker` | All other skills | Custom deep-analysis skills |
| **Skills (sub-agent)** | Batch processing, triage scoring, file scanning | Fan-out analysis, content scoring | Rare — only for complex synthesis |

### Cost Optimisation Tips

1. **Use Haiku for batch agents** — Tagging 100 notes with Haiku costs $0.28 vs $1.40 with Sonnet
2. **Use the triage pattern** — Score 20 items with Haiku ($0.11), deeply process only 4 with Sonnet ($1.20) = $1.31 vs $6.50 for all 20
3. **Benefit from prompt caching** — Structure prompts with static instructions first; 90% cache savings after 2+ requests
4. **Limit fan-out agents to 3-5** — Beyond 5, coordinator overhead negates speedup gains
5. **Choose the right coordinator model** — Skills with simple synthesis can use Sonnet; only use Opus when the synthesis requires deep reasoning
