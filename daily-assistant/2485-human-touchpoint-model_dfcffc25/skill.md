# Human Touchpoint Model

ARL-derived escalation decision model for determining when the development harness should pause for human review versus proceeding autonomously.

---

## Principle

Not every stage transition requires human approval. The harness uses constraint analysis to make escalation decisions deterministically. This model replaces arbitrary "review every plan" checkpoints with condition-based gates that escalate only when the agent cannot safely proceed.

## Escalation Decision Flowchart

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Gate([Stage Transition]) --> ConstraintCheck[Classify constraints from current stage output]
    ConstraintCheck --> CType{Constraint type?}
    CType -->|All BOUND| RiskCheck{Risk assessment}
    CType -->|Any UNBOUND| EscCheck{Unbound constraint critical?}
    CType -->|MIXED| MixedCheck{Can unbound constraints be isolated?}
    EscCheck -->|Yes — blocks correctness| Escalate[ESCALATE to human]
    EscCheck -->|No — does not block progress| Proceed[PROCEED autonomously]
    MixedCheck -->|Yes — isolate to specific tasks| PartialProceed[Proceed with bound tasks; escalate unbound]
    MixedCheck -->|No — tightly coupled| Escalate
    RiskCheck --> Reversible{Change reversible?}
    Reversible -->|Yes — local scope, can revert| Proceed
    Reversible -->|No — irreversible, broad scope| DomainCheck{Domain knowledge available?}
    DomainCheck -->|Yes — patterns exist in codebase| Proceed
    DomainCheck -->|No — insider/tribal knowledge needed| Escalate
    Proceed --> Continue([Continue to next stage])
    PartialProceed --> Continue

    HumanReview --> Continue

## Constraint Types

### Bound Constraints

Constraints where all necessary information is available and deterministic.

**Indicators:**

- Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- Integration points are documented in the codebase
- Patterns exist in existing code to follow
- Dependencies are versioned and available
- No ambiguous requirements remain

**Action:** Proceed autonomously.

### Unbound Constraints

Constraints where information is missing, ambiguous, or requires external knowledge.

**Indicators:**

- Requirements contain undefined terms or vague language
- No existing pattern in the codebase to follow
- Business logic requires domain expertise not in documentation
- Trade-offs exist that reflect organizational priorities (not technical ones)
- External system behavior is undocumented or untestable

**Action:** Escalate to human for the specific constraint. If the unbound constraint can be isolated to a specific task, other tasks may proceed.

### Mixed Constraints

Some constraints are bound, others are unbound.

**Decision:** Determine if the unbound constraints can be isolated.

- **Isolatable** — Proceed with bound tasks. Mark unbound tasks as blocked. Human unblocks specific tasks.
- **Coupled** — Unbound constraints affect the bound ones. Escalate the entire stage output.

---

## Risk Assessment

When all constraints are bound, assess the risk level of proceeding.

### Low Risk (proceed autonomously)

- Changes are **reversible** (can be reverted with git, undo, or redeployment)
- Changes have **local scope** (affect one module, one file, one feature)
- Changes follow **existing patterns** (not introducing novel architecture)
- Changes have **test coverage** (existing tests validate the approach)

### High Risk (consider escalation)

- Changes are **irreversible** (database migrations, API contract changes, published releases)
- Changes have **broad scope** (affect multiple modules, cross-cutting concerns)
- Changes introduce **novel architecture** (new patterns not seen in the codebase)
- Changes affect **external contracts** (API signatures consumed by other services)

High risk with available domain knowledge (patterns exist) proceeds. High risk without domain knowledge escalates.

---

## Domain Knowledge Assessment

When risk is high but constraints are bound, check if domain knowledge is available.

### Available in Context

- Codebase has examples of similar changes
- Documentation explains the architectural decision
- Test suite covers the relevant behavior
- Configuration files declare the expected patterns

**Action:** Proceed — the agent has sufficient information.

### Insider/Tribal Knowledge Needed

- The decision depends on organizational priorities not documented anywhere
- The change affects workflows only described in team conversations
- Historical context (why something was built a certain way) is required
- Stakeholder preferences influence the approach

**Action:** Escalate — the agent cannot safely make this decision.

## Pre-Scheduled Gates

The default pipeline has two pre-scheduled touchpoint gates:

**Gate 1 — After S1 Discovery, before S2 Planning:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S1Done([S1 Discovery Complete]) --> Eval1[Evaluate discovery findings]
    Eval1 --> Q1{Any unbound constraints in requirements?}
    Q1 -->|No — requirements clear, context sufficient| Skip1[Skip gate — proceed to S2]
    Q1 -->|Yes — ambiguous requirements, missing context| Pause1[Gate activates — escalate to human]
    Eval1 --> Q2{Domain knowledge gaps?}
    Q2 -->|No — patterns exist, docs sufficient| Skip1
    Q2 -->|Yes — insider knowledge needed| Pause1
    Pause1 --> HumanS1[Human clarifies requirements/context]
    HumanS1 --> S2([S2 Planning])
    Skip1 --> S2
```

**Gate 2 — After S4 Task Decomposition, before S5 Execution:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S4Done([S4 Task Decomposition Complete]) --> Eval2[Evaluate task complexity]
    Eval2 --> Q3{Task complexity level?}
    Q3 -->|Routine — follows existing patterns| Skip2[Skip gate — proceed to S5]
    Q3 -->|High — novel architecture, many unknowns| Pause2[Gate activates — escalate to human]
    Eval2 --> Q4{Novel architecture introduced?}
    Q4 -->|No — uses established patterns| Skip2
    Q4 -->|Yes — new patterns, structural changes| Pause2
    Pause2 --> HumanS4[Human reviews task plan and assignments]
    HumanS4 --> S5([S5 Execution])
    Skip2 --> S5
```

---

## Dynamic Escalation Points

Beyond pre-scheduled gates, the harness escalates on these conditions:

- **NEEDS_WORK loop limit** — 3 iterations in S6 Forensic Review without resolution
- **NOT_CERTIFIED loop limit** — 2 iterations in S7 Final Verification without resolution
- **Agent failure** — A specialist agent fails to produce an artifact (timeout, error, empty output)
- **Quality gate cascade failure** — All quality gates fail simultaneously (indicates fundamental issue)
- **Contradiction detected** — S3 Context Integration finds the plan contradicts codebase state and cannot reconcile

---

## Escalation Format

When escalating, the harness presents:

1. **What stage** produced the escalation
2. **What triggered** the escalation (specific constraint, risk factor, or loop limit)
3. **What the agent knows** (bound constraints, available context)
4. **What the agent does not know** (unbound constraints, missing information)
5. **Decision options** — concrete choices the human can make to unblock

The harness does NOT present vague requests like "please review." It presents specific decision forks.
