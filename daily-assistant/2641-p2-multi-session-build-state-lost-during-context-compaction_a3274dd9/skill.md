name: Multi-session build state lost during context compaction
description: "During the agentskill-kaizen build (8-phase `/plugin-dev:create-plugin`
  workflow), context compaction mid-build converted structured task state into a narrative
  summary. The resuming session had to reconstruct \"what's done vs pending\" from
  prose rather than a checklist. Background agent results that were already consumed
  and applied reappeared as late notifications after compaction, requiring manual
  deduplication (\"did I already handle this?\"). No persistent artifact tracked phase
  completion, commit SHAs per phase, deferred items, or agent result consumption status.\n\
  **Observed symptoms**:\n- Phase completion status existed only in ephemeral context
  — lost on compaction\n- Background agent notifications arrived after their findings
  were already applied (3 duplicate notifications)\n- Plan committed early (`87a0b93`)
  diverged from actual implementation but was never updated\n- No mechanism to mark
  agent results as \"consumed\" — each notification required re-evaluation"
