# NHL Data

## Setup

Before first use, check if the CLI is available:
```bash
which sports-skills || pip install sports-skills
```
If `pip install` fails with a Python version error, the package requires Python 3.10+. Find a compatible Python:
```bash
python3 --version  # check version
# If < 3.10, try: python3.12 -m pip install sports-skills
# On macOS with Homebrew: /opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 -m pip install sports-skills
```
No API keys required.

## Quick Start

Prefer the CLI — it avoids Python import path issues:
```bash
sports-skills nhl get_scoreboard
sports-skills nhl get_standings --season=2025
sports-skills nhl get_teams
```

## Choosing the Season

Derive the current year from the system prompt's date (e.g., `currentDate: 2026-02-18` → current year is 2026).

- **If the user specifies a season**, use it as-is.
- **If the user says "current", "this season", or doesn't specify**: The NHL season runs October–June. If the current month is October–December, the active season year matches the current year. If January–June, the active season started the previous calendar year (use that year as the season).
- **Example:** Current date is February 2026 → active season started October 2025 → use season `2025`.
- **Never hardcode a season.** Always derive it from the system date.

## Examples

```bash
sports-skills nhl get_scoreboard
```

**User: "Show me the Eastern Conference standings"**
```bash
sports-skills nhl get_standings --season=2025
```
Then filter results for Eastern Conference.

**User: "Who's on the Maple Leafs roster?"**
```bash
sports-skills nhl get_team_roster --team_id=21
```

**User: "Show me the full box score for last night's Bruins game"**
1. Find the event_id from `get_scoreboard --date=YYYY-MM-DD`

sports-skills nhl get_injuries

Then filter results for Toronto Maple Leafs (team_id=21).

**User: "What are the Stanley Cup odds?"**
```bash
sports-skills nhl get_futures --limit=10

```bash
sports-skills nhl get_player_stats --player_id=3895074

## Error Handling

When a command fails, **do not surface raw errors to the user**. Instead:
1. Catch silently and try alternatives
2. If team name given instead of ID, use `get_teams` to find the ID first
3. Only report failure with a clean message after exhausting alternatives

## Troubleshooting

- **`sports-skills` command not found**: Run `pip install sports-skills`
- **Team not found**: Use `get_teams` to list all teams and find the correct ID
- **No data for future games**: ESPN only returns data for completed or in-progress games
- **Offseason**: `get_scoreboard` returns 0 events — expected. Use `get_standings` or `get_news` instead.
