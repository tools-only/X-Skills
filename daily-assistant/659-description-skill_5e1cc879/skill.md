# Review Plugin for Refactor Workflow

You MUST assess a plugin and create comprehensive refactoring plans following this multi-phase workflow. After planning completes, the orchestrator can launch parallel agents to execute tasks.

<plugin_name>
$ARGUMENTS
</plugin_name>

## Mission

EXECUTE all four phases sequentially. Each phase depends on the previous phase's output. After each phase completes, DISPLAY a structured summary with key findings and file paths before proceeding to the next phase.

RETURN to the orchestrator after Phase 4 completes so parallel agent execution can begin.

---

## Completion Tracking (MANDATORY)

**IMMEDIATELY** after reading this command, you MUST create tasks using TaskCreate with this exact checklist:

```
TaskCreate(subject="Phase 1: Generate Plugin Assessment Report", description="Generate comprehensive Plugin Assessment Report by analyzing plugin structure, quality, and refactoring opportunities", activeForm="Generating Plugin Assessment Report")
TaskCreate(subject="Phase 2: Create refactoring design map", description="Create detailed refactoring design specification at .claude/plan/refactor-design-{slug}.md showing how each identified issue should be addressed", activeForm="Creating refactoring design map")
TaskCreate(subject="Phase 3: Create task file", description="Create implementation task file at .claude/plan/tasks-refactor-{slug}.md with dependencies, verification steps, and parallel execution opportunities", activeForm="Creating refactoring task file")
TaskCreate(subject="Phase 3: Update REFACTOR-PLAN.md", description="Update REFACTOR-PLAN.md index with new checklist items for this refactoring project", activeForm="Updating REFACTOR-PLAN.md index")
TaskCreate(subject="Phase 4: Gather refactoring context", description="Gather comprehensive refactoring context for task file including skill content summaries and cross-references", activeForm="Gathering refactoring context")
TaskCreate(subject="Final: Return to orchestrator", description="Return to orchestrator with execution plan and parallelization groups", activeForm="Returning execution plan to orchestrator")
```

**RULES**:

1. Create ALL tasks BEFORE starting Phase 1
2. Mark each task `in_progress` using TaskUpdate BEFORE starting that work
3. Mark each task `completed` using TaskUpdate AFTER verification passes
4. DO NOT display final summary until ALL tasks are `completed`
5. If any verification fails, keep task as `in_progress` and fix before proceeding

---

## Phase 1: Plugin Assessment

**Objective**: Generate a comprehensive Plugin Assessment Report by analyzing the plugin structure, quality, and refactoring opportunities.

**Action**: LAUNCH the plugin-assessor agent using the Task tool with this exact prompt:

```
Task(
    agent="plugin-assessor",
    prompt="""
Your ROLE_TYPE is sub-agent.

Assess the plugin at ./plugins/$ARGUMENTS for structural correctness, quality issues, and refactoring opportunities.

<context>
WHERE you are working:
- Plugin root: ./plugins/$ARGUMENTS
- Plugin manifest: ./plugins/$ARGUMENTS/.claude-plugin/plugin.json
- Skills directory: ./plugins/$ARGUMENTS/skills/
- Commands directory: ./plugins/$ARGUMENTS/commands/ (if exists)
- Agents directory: ./plugins/$ARGUMENTS/agents/ (if exists)

WHAT already exists:
- Reference skills for validation: claude-skills-overview-2026, claude-plugins-reference-2026, claude-hooks-reference-2026
- Plugin schema requirements from Claude Code marketplace
</context>

<success_criteria>
MUST deliver:
1. Complete Plugin Assessment Report with ALL sections populated
2. Overall score out of 100
3. Marketplace readiness determination (Yes / No / With Changes)
4. All skills analyzed with line counts and quality scores
5. All orphaned files identified and classified
6. Specific refactoring recommendations with severity levels
</success_criteria>

<exploration_steps>
EXECUTE the full plugin-assessor protocol:
1. Phase 1: Discovery - scan plugin structure
2. Phase 2: Manifest Validation - validate plugin.json
3. Phase 3: Skills Analysis - analyze all SKILL.md files and references
4. Phase 4: Commands Analysis - if commands/ exists
5. Phase 5: Agents Analysis - if agents/ exists
6. Phase 6: Hooks Validation - if hooks exist
7. Phase 7: MCP Configuration - if .mcp.json exists
8. Phase 8: Cross-Reference Analysis - link validation, orphan detection
9. Phase 9: Enhancement Identification - refactoring opportunities
</exploration_steps>

<output_specification>
GENERATE a Plugin Assessment Report with these key sections:

### Executive Summary
- Overall Score: X/100
- Marketplace Ready: Yes / No / With Changes
- Critical Issues: count
- Skills needing refactoring: list (>500 lines or multi-domain)
- Agents needing optimization: list
- Orphaned files: count

### Skills Analysis Table
| Skill | Lines | Status | Description Quality | Orphans | Refactor Needed |
|-------|-------|--------|---------------------|---------|-----------------|

### Refactoring Recommendations
Categorized by:
- SKILL_SPLIT: Skills >500 lines or covering multiple domains
- AGENT_OPTIMIZE: Agents with vague instructions or poor triggers
- DOC_IMPROVE: Skills/agents with low description quality
- ORPHAN_RESOLVE: Orphaned files needing integration or removal
- STRUCTURE_FIX: Structural issues (broken links, missing files)

Each recommendation must include:
- Target file path
- Issue type and severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Recommended agent: plugin-creator:refactor-skill | subagent-refactorer | claude-context-optimizer | plugin-docs-writer
- Expected outcome
</output_specification>

<available_resources>
- Full read access to ./plugins/$ARGUMENTS/ directory
- Reference skills loaded: claude-skills-overview-2026, claude-plugins-reference-2026
- Plugin schema validation knowledge
</available_resources>
"""
)
```

**Phase 1 Completion Requirements**:

After the plugin-assessor agent completes, YOU MUST:

1. **UPDATE TASK**: Mark "Phase 1: Generate Plugin Assessment Report" as `in_progress` before verification
2. VERIFY the agent produced a complete Plugin Assessment Report
3. DISPLAY this structured summary:

```
=== PHASE 1 COMPLETE: Plugin Assessed ===

Plugin: $ARGUMENTS
Overall Score: [X/100]
Marketplace Ready: [Yes / No / With Changes]
Critical Issues: [count]

Skills Analyzed: [count]
- Skills >500 lines (refactor candidates): [list]
- Skills with multi-domain coverage: [list]

Agents Analyzed: [count]
- Agents needing optimization: [list]

Orphaned Files: [count]
Documentation Quality Issues: [count]

Assessment Report: [inline or note that it's in agent output]
```

4. CONFIRM all sections are populated before proceeding to Phase 2
5. If any section is incomplete, STOP and request the agent to complete it
6. **UPDATE TASK**: Mark "Phase 1: Generate Plugin Assessment Report" as `completed`

---

## Phase 2: Refactoring Design Map

**Objective**: Create a detailed refactoring design specification showing how each identified issue should be addressed.

**Action**: LAUNCH the python-cli-design-spec agent using the Task tool with this exact prompt (substitute the complete Assessment Report from Phase 1 where indicated):

```
Task(
    agent="python-cli-design-spec",
    prompt="""
Your ROLE_TYPE is sub-agent.

<assessment_report>
[SUBSTITUTE: Insert the complete Plugin Assessment Report from Phase 1 here]
</assessment_report>

<context>
WHERE you are designing:
- Plugin root: ./plugins/$ARGUMENTS
- Existing skill structure: ./plugins/$ARGUMENTS/skills/
- Claude Code skill format reference: claude-skills-overview-2026

WHAT patterns to follow:
- Skills should be <500 lines with progressive disclosure via references/
- Skills should cover single domain (not multi-domain)
- Agent descriptions need trigger keywords for delegation matching
- Frontmatter must follow Claude Code schema exactly
- Reference files must be linked from SKILL.md
</context>

4. For skills needing split: ANALYZE content domains and propose partition plan
5. For agents needing optimization: IDENTIFY specific improvements
6. For orphaned files: DETERMINE integration or removal strategy
</exploration_steps>

<design_specifications>
DESIGN and DOCUMENT these aspects for each refactoring target:

### For SKILL_SPLIT targets:
- Current skill path and line count
- Identified domains within the skill
- Proposed new skills with names and scopes
- Content distribution plan (which sections go where)
- Shared references strategy
- Backward compatibility (if skill is externally referenced)

### For AGENT_OPTIMIZE targets:

### For ORPHAN_RESOLVE targets:
- Orphaned file path
- Classification (New Content / Duplicate / Notes / Outdated)
- Integration target or removal justification
- Proposed link location if integrating
</design_specifications>

<file_naming>
Generate a slug from the plugin name using these rules:
1. Use the plugin directory name directly (already lowercase with hyphens)
Example: "python3-development" → "python3-development"
</file_naming>

<output_file_structure>
WRITE the specification to: .claude/plan/refactor-design-{plugin-slug}.md

MUST use this exact structure:

6. If the file is missing or incomplete, STOP and request the agent to complete it
7. **UPDATE TASK**: Mark "Phase 2: Create refactoring design map" as `completed`

---

## Phase 3: Task Planning

**Objective**: Generate detailed implementation tasks with dependencies, verification steps, and parallel execution opportunities.

**Action**: LAUNCH a swarm-task-planner agent using the Task tool with this exact prompt:

````
Task(
    agent="swarm-task-planner",
    prompt="""
Your ROLE_TYPE is sub-agent.

<design_file_location>
READ the refactoring design from Phase 2 at: .claude/plan/refactor-design-{plugin-slug}.md
</design_file_location>

<context>
WHERE you are planning:
- Plan directory: .claude/plan/
- Task file destination: .claude/plan/tasks-refactor-{plugin-slug}.md
- Plan index: .claude/plan/REFACTOR-PLAN.md (create if not exists)

WHAT task structure to follow:

   ```markdown
   # Plugin Refactoring Plan Index

   ## Active Refactoring Projects

   | Plugin | Task File | Status | Score Before | Score After |
   |--------|-----------|--------|--------------|-------------|

   ## Completed Refactoring Projects

   | Plugin | Task File | Completion Date | Score Improvement |
   |--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
   ```

   ADD new entry to Active Refactoring Projects:
   ```markdown
   | {plugin-name} | [tasks-refactor-{slug}.md](tasks-refactor-{slug}.md) | ❌ NOT STARTED | {score}/100 | TBD |
   ```

</planning_steps>

================================================================================
```

</final_summary_structure>

4. **UPDATE TASK**: Mark "Final: Return to orchestrator with execution plan" as `completed`

**WORKFLOW COMPLETE** - Control returns to orchestrator for parallel execution.

---

## Workflow Guidelines

**Sequential Dependency Requirements**:

Each phase MUST complete before the next begins:

- Phase 1 output (assessment) → Phase 2 input
- Phase 2 output (design map) → Phase 3 input
- Phase 3 output (task file) → Phase 4 input
- Phase 4 output (context) → Orchestrator execution

**Slug Generation**:

Use the plugin directory name directly (already lowercase with hyphens):

- `python3-development` → `python3-development`
- `gitlab-skill` → `gitlab-skill`

**Quality Assurance**:

At each phase completion:

- VERIFY all required files exist
- CONFIRM all sections are populated
- VALIDATE format matches specifications
- STOP if incomplete and request agent to fix
