# POC: Native Task Integration Evaluation

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Created**: 2025-01-23
**Related**: TASK-34

---

## 1. Feature Description

Evaluate Claude Code's native task management tools (TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskGet, TaskList) for potential integration with Navigator's workflow systems.

**Current State**:
- Claude Code v2.1.16+ provides native task tools
- Native tasks are **session-only** (ephemeral)
- Navigator uses `.agent/tasks/` for persistent documentation
- TodoWrite tool provides in-conversation task lists

**Hypothesis**: Native tasks could provide better UX for in-session tracking (Loop Mode iterations, Task Mode phases) while `.agent/` continues to provide persistence.

---

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Research & Discovery (1-2 hours)

1. **Document native task API**
   - Test TaskCreate with sample tasks
   - Test TaskUpdate status transitions
   - Test TaskGet/TaskList retrieval
   - Document dependency tracking (blockedBy/blocks)
   - Identify any UI integration or visibility

2. **Compare with TodoWrite**
   - What does TodoWrite provide?
   - How do native tasks differ?
   - Can both coexist?

3. **Test session persistence**
   - Create tasks, compact context, check survival
   - Create tasks, end session, check survival
   - Confirm ephemeral nature

### Phase 2: Integration Design (1-2 hours)

4. **Map to Navigator workflow**
   ```
   Loop Mode:
     INIT → TaskCreate("Loop: {goal}", pending)
     Each iteration → TaskUpdate(id, {phase, progress})
     EXIT_SIGNAL → TaskUpdate(id, completed)

   Task Mode:
     Detection → TaskCreate("Task: {summary}", pending)
     Phase transition → TaskUpdate(id, {phase: PLAN|IMPL|VERIFY})
     Completion → TaskUpdate(id, completed)
   ```

5. **Design skill integration points**
   - nav-loop: Use native tasks for iteration tracking
   - nav-task-mode: Use for phase progression
   - Keep `.agent/tasks/` for documentation (unchanged)

### Phase 3: Prototype (2-3 hours)

6. **Create test skill wrapper**
   - Add native task calls to nav-loop
   - Test with real workflow
   - Measure UX improvement

7. **Evaluate results**
   - Does native task UI add value?
   - Is complexity justified?
   - Any conflicts with WORKFLOW CHECK?

### Phase 4: Decision (30 min)

8. **Write recommendation**
   - Integrate vs Don't integrate
   - If integrate: Full integration plan
   - If don't: Document reasons, close TASK-34

## 3. Files to Modify (If Integration Proceeds)

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `skills/nav-loop/SKILL.md` | Add TaskCreate/Update calls |
| `skills/nav-task-mode/SKILL.md` | Add phase tracking via tasks |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Document native task usage |
| `.agent/DEVELOPMENT-README.md` | Update workflow docs |
| `.agent/tasks/TASK-34*.md` | Archive with decision |

---

## 4. Expected Outcome

**Deliverable**: Evaluation report answering:

1. **Native Task Capabilities**
   - What tools exist (confirmed API)
   - Session vs persistent behavior
   - UI/visibility features

2. **TodoWrite Comparison**
   - Overlap assessment
   - Use case differentiation

3. **Navigator Integration Assessment**
   - Value add for Loop Mode
   - Value add for Task Mode
   - Complexity cost analysis

4. **Recommendation**
   - Integrate / Don't integrate / Partial
   - Rationale with evidence
   - Implementation path (if proceeding)

## Decision Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| UX improvement | High | Does native UI provide value? |
| Complexity cost | High | Is integration worth effort? |
| Workflow alignment | Medium | Fits Loop/Task Mode patterns? |
| Conflict risk | Medium | Interferes with WORKFLOW CHECK? |
| Maintenance burden | Low | Ongoing maintenance cost? |

---

## Notes

- TASK-34 exists as backlog item - this POC provides evaluation
- Native tasks confirmed in Claude Code v2.1.16+
- Key distinction: ephemeral (native) vs persistent (Navigator)
- TodoWrite already provides in-conversation tracking
