description: Turn the idea for a feature into a fully-formed PRD/design/specification and implementation-plan. Use when you have a spec or requirements that needs implementation. Use in pre-implementation (idea-to-design) stages to make sure you understand the spec/requirements and ensure you have a correct implementation plan before writing actual code.

# Task Analysis Process

**Goal: Before writing any code, make sure you understand the requirements and have an implementation plan ready.**

## Ideas and Prototypes

_Use this for ideas that are not fully thought out and do not have a fully-formed PRD/design/specification and/or implementation-plan._

**For example:** I've got an idea I want to talk through with you before we proceed with the implementation.

**Your job:** Help me turn it into a fully formed design and spec, and eventually an implementation plan.

See [idea-process.md](./idea-process.md).

## Existing task-master tasks

_For tasks that already exist in task-master._

**For example:** Let's work on task 6 next.

**Your job:** Make sure the task is well-documented and you fully understand the requirements and how to implement it. Then implement the task using `implementation-process` skill.

See [existing-task-process.md](./existing-task-process.md).
