# Context

Current guidance allows tasks to proliferate without clear Epic/UserStory boundaries. We need explicit criteria in SKILL.md.

# Goal

Add concise rules in SKILL.md describing when to open Epic, Feature, UserStory, or Task.

# Approach

Define a short decision rubric and examples; keep it brief and aligned with existing backlog discipline.

# Acceptance Criteria

SKILL.md includes a clear section with criteria for Epic/Feature/UserStory/Task and examples.

# Risks / Dependencies

Overly rigid rules may slow work; keep guidance lightweight.

# Worklog
