# Mistake Patterns

Track recurring mistakes to prevent them. When you notice something going wrong repeatedly, document it here so the AI can help you avoid it.

## Active Patterns

> Add patterns here as you discover them. Each pattern should have:
> - A clear name
> - What triggers it
> - The impact
> - How to avoid it

### Example Pattern — Task Scope Creep
- **Trigger**: Starting a task without clear boundaries
- **Impact**: Tasks take 3x longer than expected
- **Mitigation**: Always define "done" before starting

## Resolved Patterns

> Move patterns here when you've successfully changed the behavior

---

## How to Use

1. When you notice a recurring mistake, add it to Active Patterns
2. Include specific triggers so the AI can spot them early
3. Once you've changed the behavior for 2+ weeks, move to Resolved
4. Review this file during weekly reviews

The AI will surface relevant patterns during session start.
