# TechCorp Documentation Requirements

## Company Profile

**Company**: TechCorp Solutions  
**Type**: Mid-Market Managed Service Provider (MSP)  
**Size**: 45 employees, managed service provider  
**Specialization**: Azure cloud migrations and managed services

## Project Context

### Customer Engagement

**Client**: RetailMax Inc. (regional retail chain)  
**Project**: Datacenter-to-Azure migration  
**Scope**: 50 servers, 15 applications, 8TB data  
**Timeline**: 6-month migration completed  
**Project Status**: Azure migration complete, within allocated budget

### The Documentation Challenge

**Situation**: Migration complete, infrastructure deployed, applications running successfully in Azure. Customer now expects comprehensive documentation as part of project deliverable.

**Customer Expectations**:

1. Architecture documentation showing how everything connects
2. Operational runbooks for day-to-day management
3. Troubleshooting guides for common issues
4. API documentation for integration points
5. Disaster recovery procedures
6. Cost management and optimization guidance

**Problem**: TechCorp sold migration services, not documentation services. Documentation wasn't scoped or budgeted. But customer (rightfully) expects professional handoff documentation.

### Business Impact

**If documentation not delivered**:

- ❌ Customer satisfaction impact (threatens referrals)
- ❌ Professional reputation damage
- ❌ Potential contract disputes
- ❌ Difficulty closing final invoice
- ❌ No reference customer for marketing

**Traditional approach**:

- Assign senior engineer for 20 hours (significant time investment)
- Delay project closure by 1 week
- Eat cost to maintain customer relationship
- Documentation still incomplete (60% done, "good enough")

## Success Criteria

### Documentation Quality Metrics

**Completeness**:

- ✅ Target: 95%+ of all components documented
- ✅ Manual baseline: ~60% (always missing sections)
- ✅ Copilot advantage: Template-driven ensures nothing skipped

**Accuracy**:

- ✅ Target: 100% match with deployed infrastructure
- ✅ Manual risk: Human error, copy-paste mistakes
- ✅ Copilot advantage: Automated extraction from Azure

**Consistency**:

- ✅ Target: 100% template compliance
