  This gathers all information on the account - stakeholders, history, opportunities, 
  risks - and creates a structured account plan so you have a clear strategy for 
  growing the relationship.

- Check 05-Areas/Companies/ for company page
- Look for company pages in 05-Areas/Companies/

### Person Pages

## Step 2: Analyze Stakeholder Map

- Economic Buyer: Final decision authority
- Technical Buyer: Evaluates product fit
- User: Day-to-day product user
- Blocker: Resistant or hostile

**Influence and Support:**
- High influence, high support = Key Champion
- High influence, low support = Risk / Blocker
- Low influence, high support = User Champion
- Low influence, low support = Monitor

**Relationship Strength:**
- Strong: Regular contact, mutual trust
- Moderate: Occasional contact, professional
- Weak: Minimal contact or new relationship
- None: Haven't connected

   - Competitive alternatives they're using
   
3. **Relationship opportunities:**
   - Executives we haven't met
   - Teams we're not working with
   - Events/conferences they attend

### Risk Factors

1. **Churn risk:**
