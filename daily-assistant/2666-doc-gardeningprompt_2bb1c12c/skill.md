# Doc Gardening

Scan the repository for entropy and update health metrics.

## Tasks

1. Stale documentation — run `node scripts/check-docs-freshness.mjs` and flag files not updated
   in >90 days
2. Instruction/skill drift — run `node scripts/validate-instruction-references.mjs` to find
   orphaned references from deleted/renamed instructions
3. Cross-reference integrity — run `node scripts/validate-skills-format.mjs` and
   `node scripts/validate-agent-frontmatter.mjs`
4. Quality score review — read `QUALITY_SCORE.md`, compare grades against current state,
   propose updates
5. Tech debt inventory — read `docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`, verify items still
   relevant, add new discoveries

## Output

- Update `QUALITY_SCORE.md` with revised grades and change log entries
- Update `docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md` with new/resolved items
- Report summary of findings to the user
