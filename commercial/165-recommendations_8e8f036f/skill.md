- Search is fast and accurate

## Analysis Guidance
Summarize the following in a detailed style.

## Goal Status
# Goals at Risk or Behind

Based on the provided data and Q1 2025 goals, the following goals are **at risk**:

1. **Reduce p95 API latency to under 200ms**
   - Current: 245ms
   - Target: <200ms
   - Gap: 45ms over target
   - Status: **AT RISK**

2. **Improve onboarding completion rate to 85%**
   - Current: Not explicitly stated, but user feedback indicates "Onboarding was confusing at first"
   - Target: 85%
   - Status: **AT RISK** (implied by negative feedback)

3. **Launch mobile offline mode**
   - Current: Not launched
   - Target: Q1 2025 launch
   - User feedback: "Mobile app needs offline support"
   - Status: **AT RISK** (dependent on development completion)

## Goals On Track

- **Increase DAU by 20%**: Current DAU is 45,000; needs to reach 54,000 (feasible given MAU of 180,000)
- **NPS score above 50**: Mixed feedback suggests achievable
- **Churn rate below 3%**: No current data provided
- **Feature adoption above 75%**: Current adoption is 67%, close to target (achievable with 8% improvement)

## Recommended Actions

# I'd be happy to provide prioritized recommendations, but I don't see the pain points, goal gaps, or context from your analysis above.

To give you specific, actionable recommendations with clear impact projections, please share:

1. **Pain points identified** - What challenges or problems were uncovered?
2. **Goal gaps** - Where is performance falling short of targets?
3. **Context** - What area/function/organization is this for? (e.g., sales, operations, customer service, product development)
4. **Current state** - Any relevant metrics, timelines, or constraints?
