## Tier 1: Foundation Techniques (1-10)

### Technique 1: First Principles Thinking

**Category:** Deconstruction

**When to Use:**
- Existing solutions feel inadequate
- Industry "best practices" may be wrong
- Need to find fundamental truth
- Building something genuinely new

**Mechanism:**
Strip away assumptions and conventions to reveal base truths. Rebuild solutions from fundamental physics/economics/psychology rather than analogy to existing solutions.

**Process:**
1. State the problem/goal
2. List all assumptions embedded in current approaches
3. Question each: "Is this actually true? Why?"
4. Identify fundamental truths (physics, human nature, math)
5. Rebuild solution from these truths only
6. Compare to conventional approach

**Example:**
- Problem: "How to make batteries cheaper?"
- Convention: "Negotiate with suppliers, improve manufacturing"
- First Principles: "What are batteries made of? Cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, polymers. What are spot prices of raw materials? ~$80/kWh in materials. Why do batteries cost $150/kWh? Manufacturing overhead."
- Solution: Vertical integration, novel manufacturing (Tesla approach)

**Gotchas:**
- Time-intensive; not for trivial problems
- Requires domain knowledge to identify true fundamentals
- Can lead to over-engineering

**Combines With:** Constraint Manipulation, Analogical Transfer

### Technique 2: SCAMPER

**Category:** Systematic Variation

**When to Use:**
- Need rapid ideation
- Improving existing product/process
- Structured brainstorming needed
- Team ideation sessions

**Mechanism:**
Systematic prompts force consideration of variations you'd otherwise miss. Each letter triggers different transformation type.

**SCAMPER Framework:**
| Letter | Prompt | Question |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **S** | Substitute | What can be replaced? Materials, people, processes? |
| **C** | Combine | What can merge? Features, products, markets? |
| **A** | Adapt | What can be borrowed from elsewhere? |
| **M** | Modify/Magnify/Minify | What if bigger/smaller/altered? |
| **P** | Put to other uses | What else could this do? New contexts? |
| **E** | Eliminate | What can be removed? What's not essential? |
| **R** | Reverse/Rearrange | What if opposite? Different order? |

**Process:**
1. Define object of ideation clearly
2. Go through each letter (2-3 min each)
3. Generate 2-5 ideas per letter
4. Don't judge during generation
5. Review all ideas after completing cycle
6. Select promising ideas for development

**Example:**
- Object: Coffee shop
- S: Substitute baristas with robots; coffee with adaptogenic mushrooms
- C: Combine with co-working space; combine with laundromat
- A: Adapt hotel concierge service; adapt library quiet zones
- M: Magnify to 24/7; minify to walk-up window only
- P: Put to use as event venue; as podcast recording space
- E: Eliminate seating (grab-and-go only); eliminate cash
- R: Reverse — customers make their own; subscription model

**Gotchas:**
- Can produce quantity over quality
- Some letters more productive than others
- Needs convergence phase after

**Combines With:** Random Stimulation, Six Thinking Hats

### Technique 3: Lateral Thinking (Provocation)

**Category:** Pattern Breaking

**When to Use:**
- Stuck in conventional thinking
- Need to escape dominant pattern
- Industry has standardized approaches
- Looking for breakthrough, not increment

**Mechanism:**
Deliberate provocation (PO) disrupts logical patterns, forcing brain to create new connections. "PO" signals statement is a stepping stone, not truth.

**Provocation Types:**
| Type | Method | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Escape | Drop something taken for granted | "PO cars have no wheels" |
| Reversal | State the opposite | "PO customers pay us to take products" |
| Exaggeration | Extreme magnification | "PO the factory has 10,000 workers per product" |
| Distortion | Alter normal relationship | "PO the package is bigger than the product" |
| Wishful | State ideal fantasy | "PO the product assembles itself" |

**Process:**
1. State the problem
2. List assumptions/norms
3. Create provocations (PO statements)
4. "Movement" — extract useful ideas from provocation
5. Don't dismiss; ask "What's interesting here?"

**Example:**
- Problem: Airline boarding is slow
- PO: "Passengers board from the back" (reversal of typical)
- Movement: Actually... back-to-front boarding IS faster mathematically
- Idea: Redesign boarding zones based on seat location

**Gotchas:**
- Provocations can feel silly — push through
- Movement step is critical; don't skip
- Requires practice to extract value

**Combines With:** Constraint Manipulation, Random Stimulation

### Technique 4: Analogical Transfer

**Category:** Cross-Domain

**When to Use:**
- Domain expertise creating blindness
- Need breakthrough from outside
- Problem exists solved elsewhere
- Innovation via importation

**Mechanism:**
Solutions from distant domains, when mapped to your problem, bypass industry assumptions. Distance of analogy correlates with novelty of solution.

**Analogy Distance Spectrum:**
| Distance | Source | Novelty | Risk |
|----------|--------|---------|------|
| Near | Same industry | Low | Low |
| Medium | Adjacent industry | Medium | Medium |
| Far | Unrelated domain | High | High |
| Extreme | Nature/physics | Very high | Very high |

**Process:**
1. Abstract your problem to its essence
2. Identify domains that solve similar abstract problems
3. Study how they solve it
4. Map their solution back to your domain
5. Adapt for domain-specific constraints

**Example:**
- Problem: Hospital infection spread
- Abstraction: "How to prevent contagion in high-traffic environments?"
- Distant domain: Airlines (also high-traffic, contamination concerns)
- Airline solution: HEPA filters, air flow patterns, surface materials
- Transfer: Hospital HVAC redesign based on aircraft air handling

**Gotchas:**
- Far analogies require more adaptation
- Surface similarities can mislead
- Domain knowledge needed to adapt properly

**Combines With:** First Principles, Random Stimulation

### Technique 5: Constraint Manipulation

**Category:** Reframing

**When to Use:**
- Problem feels impossible
- Hidden constraints limiting options
- Need to test what's truly necessary
- Unlocking new solution space

**Mechanism:**
Constraints shape the solution space. By adding, removing, or flipping constraints, you reveal new possibilities invisible under original framing.

**Constraint Operations:**
| Operation | Method | Effect |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Remove | "What if X wasn't a constraint?" | Opens radical options |
| Add | "What if we also had to Y?" | Forces creativity within limits |
| Flip | "What if X were the opposite?" | Reveals hidden assumptions |
| Tighten | "What if only 10% of the budget?" | Forces prioritization |
| Loosen | "What if unlimited budget?" | Reveals ideal solution |

**Process:**
1. List all constraints (explicit and implicit)
2. Categorize: real vs. assumed
3. Select constraint to manipulate
4. Generate ideas under new constraint set
5. Map back to real constraints (what's transferable?)

**Example:**
- Problem: Need to reduce customer support costs
- Constraints: Must respond within 24 hours, must be human, must use existing software
- Remove "must be human": AI chatbot handles tier 1
- Add "must be proactive": Predict issues before customers contact
- Flip "respond to customers": Customers help each other (community)

**Gotchas:**
- Some constraints are truly immovable
- Distinguish business constraints from laws of physics
- Removed constraints may need to return

**Combines With:** First Principles, SCAMPER

### Technique 6: Random Stimulation

**Category:** Forced Connection

**When to Use:**
- Deliberate thinking exhausted
- Need unexpected connections
- Breaking out of rut
- Adding novelty injection

**Mechanism:**
Random, unrelated input forces brain to find connections it wouldn't naturally seek. Novelty of connection = novelty of idea.

**Stimulation Sources:**
| Source | Method |
|--------|--------|
| Random word | Dictionary, word generator |
| Random image | Stock photos, magazines |
| Random object | Physical objects nearby |
| Random constraint | "Must involve [random noun]" |
| Random domain | "How would [random profession] solve this?" |

**Process:**
1. Generate random stimulus (word, image, object)
2. List attributes/associations of the stimulus
3. Force connections to your problem
4. Don't dismiss weak connections — explore them
5. Develop any promising sparks

**Example:**
- Problem: Make exercise more engaging
- Random word: "Vampire"
- Associations: Night, blood, transformation, immortality, Dracula, biting
- Connections:
  - Night → 24-hour gyms, moonlight outdoor workouts
  - Blood → Heart rate gamification, "blood pumping" metrics
  - Transformation → Before/after social features
  - Immortality → Longevity tracking, "add years to your life" framing
- Idea: Fitness app that shows "years added to lifespan" as primary metric

**Gotchas:**
- Not all random inputs produce useful connections
- Requires willingness to make absurd leaps
- Need multiple attempts sometimes

**Combines With:** SCAMPER, Lateral Thinking

### Technique 7: Reverse Brainstorming

**Category:** Inversion

**When to Use:**
- Stuck on "how to improve"
- Problem seems intractable
- Need to identify failure modes
- Making implicit knowledge explicit

**Mechanism:**
Easier to identify problems than solutions. By asking "how to make worse," you surface issues that, when reversed, become solutions.

**Process:**
1. Invert the problem: "How could we make X worse?"
2. Brainstorm ways to fail/worsen enthusiastically
3. List all the "bad ideas"
4. Reverse each: "How to prevent/opposite this?"
5. The reversals are your solution candidates

**Example:**
- Problem: "How to improve customer retention?"
- Inverted: "How to lose all our customers?"
- Bad ideas:
  - Ignore their support tickets
  - Raise prices randomly
  - Make cancellation impossible
  - Never ship new features
  - Send spam constantly
- Reversed solutions:
  - Respond to tickets within 1 hour
  - Transparent, predictable pricing
  - Easy cancellation (builds trust)
  - Regular feature releases with communication
  - Relevant, permission-based communication only

**Gotchas:**
- Can surface obvious solutions
- Reversal isn't always straightforward
- Some "bad ideas" reveal real organizational problems

**Combines With:** Six Thinking Hats (Black Hat), Constraint Manipulation

### Technique 8: Worst Possible Idea

**Category:** Pressure Release

**When to Use:**
- Team is self-censoring
- Fear of bad ideas blocking flow
- Need to lower the stakes
- Warming up for ideation

**Mechanism:**
Permission to be bad removes fear of judgment. Bad ideas often contain seeds of good ideas. Laughter releases creative tension.

**Process:**
1. Explicitly ask for terrible ideas
2. Compete to be worst (gamify it)
3. Celebrate the most ridiculous
4. After exhausting bad ideas, examine them
5. Ask: "What's interesting in this bad idea?"
6. Extract and develop useful elements

**Example:**
- Problem: "How to get more app downloads?"
- Worst ideas:
  - Pay people to uninstall competitor apps
  - Make the app so bad people hate-share it
  - Kidnap phone manufacturers, pre-install app
  - App gives you a disease, only cure is more app usage
- Extraction:
  - "Hate-share" → Viral controversy marketing (risky but real)
  - "Pre-install" → OEM partnerships (legitimate strategy)
  - "More usage = cure" → Habit loops, streak mechanics

**Gotchas:**
- Some people struggle with permission to be bad
- Needs facilitator to maintain energy
- Must transition to serious evaluation eventually

**Combines With:** Reverse Brainstorming, Random Stimulation

### Technique 9: Six Thinking Hats

**Category:** Structured Perspectives

**When to Use:**
- Team decision-making
- Need comprehensive evaluation
- Preventing groupthink
- Separating ego from ideas

**Mechanism:**
Parallel thinking: everyone wears same "hat" simultaneously. Separates thinker from idea. Ensures all perspectives get airtime.

**The Six Hats:**
| Hat | Color | Focus | Questions |
|-----|-------|-------|-----------|
| **White** | ⚪ | Facts, data | What do we know? What data exists? |
| **Red** | 🔴 | Emotions, intuition | How do we feel? Gut reaction? |
| **Black** | ⚫ | Caution, risks | What could go wrong? Risks? |
| **Yellow** | 🟡 | Benefits, optimism | What's good? Best case? |
| **Green** | 🟢 | Creativity, alternatives | What else? New ideas? |
| **Blue** | 🔵 | Process, meta | What's our process? Next steps? |

**Process:**
1. Blue hat: Define the topic and sequence
2. White hat: Gather facts (no interpretation)
3. Green hat: Generate ideas
4. Yellow hat: Explore benefits
5. Black hat: Identify risks
6. Red hat: Gut check
7. Blue hat: Decide and plan

**Example:**
- Topic: "Should we launch in Europe?"
- ⚪ White: EU population, GDPR requirements, competitor presence, localization costs
- 🟢 Green: Partnership models, phased rollout, EU-first features
- 🟡 Yellow: Larger market, diversification, talent pool
- ⚫ Black: GDPR fines, localization cost, support timezone challenges
- 🔴 Red: Team excited but nervous; feels like a stretch
- 🔵 Blue: Decision = pilot in UK first, expand based on learnings

**Gotchas:**
- Requires discipline to stay in one hat
- Facilitator needed for groups
- Can feel artificial initially

**Combines With:** SCAMPER (under Green hat), Reverse Brainstorm (Black hat)

### Technique 10: Morphological Analysis

**Category:** Systematic Combination

**When to Use:**
- Problem has multiple dimensions
- Need exhaustive option exploration
- Combinatorial creativity needed
- Structured innovation process

**Mechanism:**
Break problem into independent dimensions, list options for each, systematically combine. Surfaces combinations you'd never consider intuitively.

**Process:**
1. Identify 3-5 key dimensions of the problem
2. List 3-5 options for each dimension
3. Create matrix/grid
4. Systematically combine (or randomly sample)
5. Evaluate interesting combinations
6. Develop promising concepts

**Example:**
- Problem: New beverage product
- Dimensions:
  - Base: Water, Milk, Tea, Coffee, Juice
  - Function: Energy, Relaxation, Hydration, Nutrition, Focus
  - Format: Can, Bottle, Powder, Concentrate, Frozen
  - Occasion: Morning, Workout, Work, Evening, Social
- Interesting combination: Tea + Focus + Powder + Work = Matcha focus powder for office workers
- Another: Milk + Relaxation + Can + Evening = Sleepy-time milk drink

**Gotchas:**
- Combinatorial explosion with many dimensions
- Not all combinations are viable
- Requires evaluation criteria to filter

**Combines With:** SCAMPER, Constraint Manipulation

## Tier 2: Advanced Techniques (11-15)

### Technique 11: Assumption Reversal

**When to Use:** All solutions feel similar; industry standardization

**Process:** List assumptions → Reverse each → Explore reversed world → Extract ideas

**Example:** Assumption: "Restaurants need kitchens" → Reversal: Ghost kitchens, delivery-only

---

### Technique 12: Problem Reversal

**When to Use:** Direct attack isn't working

**Process:** Instead of "How to achieve X?" ask "How to make X unnecessary?"

**Example:** "How to make faster horses?" → "How to make horses unnecessary?" → Automobile

---

### Technique 13: Boundary Examination

**When to Use:** Solution space feels constrained

**Process:** Map the edges of the solution space → Ask why each boundary exists → Test each boundary

---

### Technique 14: Exaptation

**When to Use:** Have existing capabilities seeking new applications

**Process:** List what you're good at → Find problems in other domains that need those capabilities

**Example:** 3M adhesive "failure" → Post-it Notes

---

### Technique 15: Synthesis Forcing

**When to Use:** Have multiple partial solutions

**Process:** Take best elements from different solutions → Force them into single coherent concept → Resolve conflicts creatively
