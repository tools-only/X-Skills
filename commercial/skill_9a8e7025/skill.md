## Dual-Perspective Output (REQUIRED)

**All customs, tariff, and trade compliance responses MUST provide two perspectives:**

### Output Format

```
## 🛡️ Conservative View
[Safest interpretation - what a risk-averse compliance officer would recommend]
- Strictest reading of regulations
- Assumes worst-case tariff classification
- Recommends binding rulings before acting
- Prioritises compliance certainty over cost savings
- "When in doubt, pay the duty and claim back later"

## 🚀 Aggressive View
[Boundary-pushing interpretation - what a strategic trade consultant would explore]
- Creative but defensible positions
- Identifies available exemptions, reliefs, and programmes
- Explores tariff engineering opportunities
- Leverages FTA provisions to maximum extent
- Considers procedural alternatives (FTZs, bonded warehouses, duty drawback)
- "Find the opportunity within the rules"

## ⚖️ Recommendation
[Which approach fits this specific situation and why]
- Risk tolerance assessment
- Volume/value considerations
- Compliance history factors
- Strategic vs tactical decision
```

### When to Apply Dual Perspective

| Scenario | Dual Output Required |
|----------|---------------------|
| Tariff classification queries | ✓ Always |
| Rules of origin determinations | ✓ Always |
| Duty rate questions | ✓ Always |
| FTA eligibility assessments | ✓ Always |
| Import/export strategy | ✓ Always |
| Landed cost calculations | ✓ Include both scenarios |
| Documentation questions | Optional (usually one correct answer) |
| Process/procedure queries | Optional |

### Conservative vs Aggressive Characteristics

| Aspect | 🛡️ Conservative | 🚀 Aggressive |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Classification | Higher duty code if ambiguous | Defensible lower duty code |
| Origin | Assume non-qualifying unless proven | Calculate RVC to find qualifying path |
| Valuation | Include all possible dutiable elements | Apply permitted deductions |
| Documentation | Full formal entry, all certificates | Simplified procedures where eligible |
| Timing | Clear goods, review later | Pre-plan to optimise before shipment |
| Risk appetite | Zero tolerance | Calculated, documented positions |
| Audit readiness | Bulletproof files | Defensible positions with reasoning |

- Proof of origin required (supplier declaration or EUR.1)
- Full customs declarations required since 2021

### Common UK Automotive Duty Rates

| Product | Commodity Code | MFN Rate | EU (TCA) |

## Incoterms 2020

### Commonly Used Terms

| Term | Full Name | Seller's Responsibility |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| **EXW** | Ex Works | Goods at seller's premises |
| **FCA** | Free Carrier | Delivered to carrier |

### Automotive Industry Standard

Most automotive OEM contracts use:
- **DDP** or **DAP** for finished vehicles
- **FCA** or **CIF** for parts
- **EXW** rarely used (shifts too much risk to buyer)

---

## Landed Cost Calculation

### Formula

```
Landed Cost = Product Cost + Freight + Insurance + Customs Duty + Taxes + Handling
```

### Detailed Breakdown

```
Product Cost (FOB)                    $10,000
+ International Freight                  $800
+ Insurance (0.5% of CIF)                $55
= CIF Value                          $10,855
+ Customs Duty (4.5%)                   $489
= Duty Paid Value                    $11,344
+ VAT/GST (20% UK / 5% Canada)        $2,269
+ Brokerage/Handling                    $150
= Total Landed Cost                  $13,763
```

## Documentation Requirements

### Standard Import Documents

| Document | UK | US | Canada |
|----------|----|----|--------|
| Commercial Invoice | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Packing List | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Bill of Lading/Airway Bill | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Certificate of Origin | If claiming preference | If claiming preference | If claiming preference |
| Entry Declaration | CDS | CBP Form 7501 | B3 |

### Automotive-Specific Documents

- **CUSMA Certificate of Origin**: For US/Canada/Mexico preferential treatment
- **EUR.1 Movement Certificate**: For UK-EU preferential treatment
- **Supplier Declaration**: Long-term or single shipment
- **IMDS/REACH Compliance**: Material declarations
- **PPAP Documentation**: When required by customer

---

## Rules of Origin

### Key Concepts

1. **Wholly Obtained**: Entirely produced in one country
2. **Substantial Transformation**: Tariff shift rule (change in HS heading)
3. **Regional Value Content (RVC)**: Percentage of value from region

### RVC Calculation Methods

**Transaction Value Method:**
```
RVC = ((TV - VNM) / TV) × 100
```
- TV = Transaction value
- VNM = Value of non-originating materials

**Net Cost Method:**
```
RVC = ((NC - VNM) / NC) × 100
```
- NC = Net cost (total cost minus royalties, shipping, packing)

### CUSMA Automotive RVC Requirements

| Product | 2020-2023 | 2024+ |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Passenger vehicles | 75% | 75% |
| Light trucks | 75% | 75% |
| Heavy trucks | 70% | 70% |
| Auto parts (core) | 75% | 75% |
| Auto parts (other) | 65-70% | 65-75% |
