# Creative Thinking Anti-Patterns

## Category 1: Process Failures

### Anti-Pattern 1: Premature Judgment

**What it looks like:**
"That won't work because..."
"We tried that before..."
"The CEO would never approve..."
Ideas killed during brainstorm.

**Why it fails:**
- Shuts down idea flow
- Creates fear of contribution
- Best ideas often sound crazy initially
- Judgment mode and generation mode conflict cognitively

**Instead:**
Strict diverge/converge separation. Write down ALL ideas. Evaluate in separate session. Use "Yes, and..." not "No, but..."

**Detection:**
Count ideas generated. If <20 in a brainstorm session, premature judgment likely active.

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Anchoring on First Idea

**What it looks like:**
First idea proposed becomes the default. All subsequent discussion refines that idea. Alternatives never explored.

**Why it fails:**
- First idea is rarely best idea
- Anchoring bias prevents seeing alternatives
- Group converges prematurely
- Opportunity cost of unexplored options

**Instead:**
Generate minimum 10 ideas before discussing any. Use techniques that force alternatives (SCAMPER, Morphological). Evaluate ideas anonymously.

**Detection:**
If final idea resembles first idea proposed, anchoring may have occurred.

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Expert Blindness

**What it looks like:**
"That's not how our industry works..."
"Customers would never..."
"The regulations don't allow..."
Deep expertise used to dismiss ideas.

**Why it fails:**
- Expertise creates assumptions that may be wrong
- Industry norms aren't laws of physics
- Outsiders often see what insiders miss
- Rules change; new entrants don't know "rules"

**Instead:**
Include non-experts in brainstorms. Explicitly challenge "obvious" constraints. Ask "Why?" five times. Study analogies from distant domains.

**Detection:**
If all ideas fit neatly within current industry practice, expert blindness is likely active.

---

### Anti-Pattern 4: Solution-First Thinking

**What it looks like:**
"We should build an AI that..."
"Let's use blockchain to..."
"What if we had an app that..."
Technology or solution proposed before problem is understood.

**Why it fails:**
- Solutions without problems find no market
- Technology isn't inherently valuable
- Skips understanding user needs
- Often creates "cool" but useless products

**Instead:**
Start with problem. Understand who has it, how painful, how frequent. Only then generate solutions. Validate problem before building solution.

**Detection:**
Can you clearly state the problem without mentioning the solution? If not, solution-first.

---

### Anti-Pattern 5: Analysis Paralysis

**What it looks like:**
"We need more research..."
"Let's survey users first..."
"What if we're wrong..."
Endless analysis, no idea commitment.

**Why it fails:**
- Creativity requires action, not just thinking
- Perfect information doesn't exist
- Delay has costs
- Analysis can become procrastination

**Instead:**
Time-box research. Use "good enough" heuristics. Test ideas quickly. Embrace "strong opinions, loosely held."

**Detection:**
If weeks pass with no concrete ideas committed to, analysis paralysis is active.

---

## Category 2: Ideation Failures

### Anti-Pattern 6: Incremental-Only Thinking

**What it looks like:**
"We could improve X by 10%..."
"Let's add a feature that..."
"What if we made it faster..."
All ideas are small improvements.

**Why it fails:**
- Incremental improvements are easily copied
- Miss paradigm shifts
- Optimize local maximum, miss global
- Competitors can incrementalize too

**Instead:**
Explicitly ask "What would 10x require?" Use First Principles. Study disruptions in other industries. Ask "What would make us obsolete?"

**Detection:**
If all ideas fit on existing product roadmap, only incremental thinking occurred.

---

### Anti-Pattern 7: Groupthink

**What it looks like:**
"We all agree that..."
"Obviously the answer is..."
"No one has concerns?"
Rapid consensus, no dissent.

**Why it fails:**
- Diversity of thought is source of creativity
- Dissent reveals blind spots
- Social pressure suppresses minority views
- Wrong consensus worse than no consensus

**Instead:**
Solicit ideas individually before group discussion. Assign devil's advocate role. Use Six Thinking Hats (Black Hat). Anonymous idea submission.

**Detection:**
If group reaches consensus in <10 minutes, groupthink likely. If all ideas similar, also suspect.

---

### Anti-Pattern 8: Copying Without Understanding

**What it looks like:**
"Let's do what [successful company] did..."
"Uber for X, Airbnb for Y..."
Direct copy of another's strategy.

**Why it fails:**
- Context differs; their solution may not fit your context
- You'll always be behind the leader
- Copying surface features misses underlying mechanisms
- "X for Y" is not a strategy

**Instead:**
Study principles behind success, not tactics. Understand WHY something worked. Adapt principles, don't copy features.

**Detection:**
If idea can be stated as "[Company] for [Category]" without deeper analysis, it's shallow copying.

---

### Anti-Pattern 9: Idea Hoarding

**What it looks like:**
"Let me think about it more before sharing..."
"It's not ready yet..."
"I don't want anyone to steal it..."
Ideas kept private instead of shared and built upon.

**Why it fails:**
- Ideas improve through feedback
- Others' perspectives add value
- Execution matters more than ideas
- Hoarded ideas never get stress-tested

**Instead:**
Share early and often. "Strong opinions, loosely held." Build on others' ideas. Remember: ideas are cheap, execution is hard.

**Detection:**
If brainstorm yields few ideas, hoarding may be occurring. Explicitly invite "half-baked" contributions.

---

### Anti-Pattern 10: Narrow Framing

**What it looks like:**
"How do we make the checkout page convert better?"
Problem stated so narrowly that only one solution type is possible.

**Why it fails:**
- Constraints solution space artificially
- May be solving wrong problem
- Prevents reframing that could unlock breakthrough
- Assumes current approach is correct

**Instead:**
Reframe problem at multiple levels. "How to increase checkout conversion?" → "How to increase revenue?" → "How to increase customer lifetime value?" → "How to create customer success?"

**Detection:**
If problem statement contains implicit solution, it's too narrow.

---

## Category 3: Evaluation Failures

### Anti-Pattern 11: HIPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion)

**What it looks like:**
CEO likes idea A. Team "decides" idea A is best. No real evaluation occurred.

**Why it fails:**
- Seniority ≠ creativity
- Power dynamics suppress dissent
- Best idea may come from anyone
- Demotivates team

**Instead:**
Anonymous idea evaluation. Structured criteria (use audit rubric). Separate idea from proposer. Leader speaks last.

**Detection:**
If final choice matches leader's initial preference, HIPPO may have occurred.

---

### Anti-Pattern 12: Novelty Bias

**What it looks like:**
"That's so innovative!"
"No one's doing this!"
Idea selected because it's new, not because it's good.

**Why it fails:**
- Novelty doesn't equal value
- Truly new things often fail (market not ready)
- Innovation for innovation's sake wastes resources
- May ignore that existing solutions work well

**Instead:**
Score ideas on value and feasibility, not just originality. Ask "Why hasn't anyone done this?" — answer may be "it doesn't work."

**Detection:**
If primary argument for idea is its novelty, novelty bias may be active.

---

### Anti-Pattern 13: Confirmation Seeking

**What it looks like:**
"Let's find data that supports this idea..."
"What do customers like about this concept?"
Seeking evidence for predetermined conclusion.

**Why it fails:**
- Ignores disconfirming evidence
- Creates false confidence
- Doesn't stress-test assumptions
- Echo chamber thinking

**Instead:**
Seek disconfirmation. Ask "What would prove this wrong?" Design experiments that can fail. Steelman opposing views.

**Detection:**
If all evidence gathered supports the idea, confirmation bias may be present.

---

## Category 4: Execution Failures

### Anti-Pattern 14: Idea Fetishism

**What it looks like:**
"The idea is so good it will sell itself..."
"We just need to build it and users will come..."
Belief that ideas are more valuable than execution.

**Why it fails:**
- Ideas are cheap; execution is hard
- Same idea, different execution = different outcomes
- Market doesn't care about ideas, only products
- Execution reveals idea flaws

**Instead:**
Treat ideas as hypotheses needing validation. Focus on learning fast. Build minimum viable version. Iterate based on reality.

**Detection:**
If conversation focuses on idea brilliance rather than execution challenges, idea fetishism present.

---

### Anti-Pattern 15: Feature Creep During Ideation

**What it looks like:**
"And it could also..."
"We should add..."
"What if it also..."
Idea grows to solve everything.

**Why it fails:**
- Complex ideas harder to execute
- Dilutes core value proposition
- Creates confusion about what it is
- Scope creep before even starting

**Instead:**
Keep ideas focused on one core problem. "What is the ONE thing this does?" Use subtraction as creative tool. Simplify ruthlessly.

**Detection:**
If idea requires a paragraph to explain, it may have crept. Core should fit in one sentence.

---
