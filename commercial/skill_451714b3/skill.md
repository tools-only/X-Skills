## Strategic Framework

### The Supply Chain Value Hierarchy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. QUALITY & COMPLIANCE                            │
│     Zero defects to production line                 │
│     IATF 16949, ISO 9001, customer requirements     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                        ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  2. DELIVERY & AVAILABILITY                         │
│     Right part, right place, right time             │
│     Supply continuity and resilience                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                        ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  3. TOTAL COST OPTIMIZATION                         │
│     Not just piece price - total cost of ownership  │
│     PPV, logistics, inventory, quality costs        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Critical Rule:** Never compromise quality or delivery for cost. A cheap part that stops the line costs far more than the savings.

```

### Supplier Scorecard Framework

| Category | Weight | Metrics |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Quality** | 40% | PPM, PPAP on-time, warranty claims, audit scores |
| **Delivery** | 30% | OTD, lead time, flexibility, communication |
| **Cost** | 20% | Price competitiveness, VA/VE, payment terms |
| **Service** | 10% | Responsiveness, technical support, innovation |

---

## Cost Management Strategies

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

```
PIECE PRICE
    + Tooling (amortized)
    + Logistics (freight, handling, duties)
    + Inventory carrying cost
    + Quality costs (inspection, sorting, returns)
    + Administrative costs (POs, invoices, management)
    + Risk premium (single source, geopolitical)
    ─────────────────────────────
    = TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP
```

### Cost Reduction Levers

| Lever | Description | Typical Savings |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Volume Leverage** | Consolidate spend, longer commitments | 3-8% |
| **Specification Review** | Over-engineering elimination | 5-15% |
| **VA/VE** | Value Analysis / Value Engineering | 10-30% |
| **Should-Cost** | Detailed cost breakdown analysis | 5-20% |
| **Resourcing** | Geographic arbitrage, new suppliers | 10-25% |
| **Process Improvement** | Supplier manufacturing efficiency | 3-10% |
| **Payment Terms** | Extend terms, capture early pay discount | 1-3% |

### Should-Cost Model Components

```
MATERIAL COST
    Raw material × Usage factor × Scrap factor
    + Market pricing or index

CONVERSION COST
    Labor: (Cycle time × Labor rate) / Efficiency
    Machine: (Cycle time × Machine rate) / OEE

OVERHEAD
    SG&A: % of conversion
    Profit: % margin (typically 5-15%)

LOGISTICS
    Packaging + Freight + Duties
```

## Negotiation Framework

### Preparation Checklist

- [ ] **BATNA** - Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement
- [ ] **ZOPA** - Zone of Possible Agreement
- [ ] **Supplier economics** - Their costs, margins, pressures
- [ ] **Market conditions** - Supply/demand, commodity trends
- [ ] **Leverage points** - Volume, specification, competition
- [ ] **Walk-away point** - Clear bottom line
- [ ] **Value creation opportunities** - Win-win possibilities

### Multi-Variable Negotiation

Don't negotiate price alone. Trade across multiple variables:

| Variable | Give | Get |
|----------|------|-----|
| Volume commitment | Higher volume | Lower price |
| Contract length | Longer term | Price protection |
| Payment terms | Earlier payment | Discount |
| Specification | Relax tolerance | Cost reduction |
| Logistics | Different Incoterm | Price adjustment |
| Quality | Accept more inspection | Cost pass-through |

### BATNA Development

Always have alternatives:
1. Identify backup suppliers (at least 2)
2. Understand switching costs and timeline
3. Maintain relationships with alternatives
4. Document qualification status
5. Never reveal desperation

## Risk Management

### Supply Risk Categories

| Risk Type | Examples | Mitigation |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Single Source** | Proprietary technology, limited capacity | Dual source, inventory buffer |
| **Financial** | Supplier bankruptcy, cash flow issues | Credit monitoring, payment terms |
| **Geopolitical** | Trade disputes, sanctions, instability | Regional diversification |
| **Operational** | Fire, flood, equipment failure | BCP review, safety stock |
| **Quality** | Systematic defects, process drift | Audit frequency, incoming inspection |
| **Capacity** | Demand surge, allocation | LTA commitments, capacity reservation |

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Probability | Low Impact | Medium Impact | High Impact |
|-------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **High** | Monitor | Mitigate | Urgent Action |
| **Medium** | Accept | Monitor | Mitigate |
| **Low** | Accept | Accept | Monitor |

## Materials Planning

### Inventory Strategy by Part Type

| Part Type | Strategy | Target DOS |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **A Items** (High value, critical) | JIT, frequent delivery | 3-5 days |
| **B Items** (Medium value) | Weekly delivery, safety stock | 7-14 days |
| **C Items** (Low value, commodity) | VMI, consignment, bulk | 30+ days |
| **Critical spares** | Buffer stock regardless of value | Per risk |

### Safety Stock Calculation

```
Safety Stock = Z × σ × √(LT + Review Period)

Where:
Z = Service level factor (95% = 1.65, 99% = 2.33)
σ = Demand standard deviation
LT = Lead time in periods
```

### MRP Best Practices

- [ ] Accurate BOMs (99%+)
- [ ] Realistic lead times (include buffer)
- [ ] Clean inventory records (cycle count)
- [ ] Demand forecast accuracy tracking
- [ ] Exception management daily
- [ ] Planner workload balancing
