## Technical Requirements

### Diagnostic Needs

Sarah needs to quickly:

1. **Identify Root Cause**:
   - Which component is failing? (App Service, SQL, Payment Gateway, Azure AD)
   - Is it infrastructure (scaling, resources) or application (code, config)?
   - When exactly did it start? (correlate with recent changes)

2. **Assess Impact**:
   - How many customers affected?
   - Which geographic regions?
   - All payment methods or specific ones?
   - Are authenticated users affected differently?

3. **Find Solution Fast**:
   - Is it temporary overload → scale up?
   - Configuration issue → rollback/fix?
   - External dependency failure → workaround?
   - Code bug → hotfix deploy?

### Constraints

- **Time Pressure**: Every hour = $22K revenue loss + customer trust erosion
- **Limited Team**: Only 2 engineers on-call (Sarah + junior teammate)
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Sarah is strong on Azure infra, less experienced with KQL
- **Change Freeze**: Development team not available until morning
- **Vendor Support**: Payment gateway support has 4-hour SLA (too slow)

## Troubleshooting Challenges

### Manual Approach Obstacles (Why 30 Hours?)

1. **KQL Learning Curve** (8 hours):
   - Sarah knows basics, but advanced queries require documentation lookup
   - Syntax errors frustrate progress: `where` vs `|`, `summarize` vs `extend`
   - Iterating through 15+ queries to find relevant data
   - Correlating data across Application Insights, Log Analytics, SQL insights

2. **Documentation Overload** (4 hours):
   - Azure docs for each service (App Service, SQL, App Gateway, AD B2C)
   - Stack Overflow searches for similar issues
   - Internal wiki (outdated, incomplete)
   - Payment gateway vendor docs

3. **Hypothesis Testing** (6 hours):
   - **Hypothesis 1**: Database performance issue
     - Check DTU usage → looks normal (60% average)
     - Check query performance → no obvious slow queries
     - Dead end (90 minutes wasted)

   - **Hypothesis 2**: App Service resource exhaustion
     - Check CPU/memory → within normal range
     - Check instance health → all healthy
     - Dead end (60 minutes wasted)

   - **Hypothesis 3**: Network/connectivity issues
     - Check NSG rules → no recent changes
     - Check Application Gateway logs → lots of 500s, but why?
     - Dead end initially, but eventually finds clue (2 hours)

4. **Vendor Support Delays** (4 hours):
   - Open ticket with payment gateway support
   - Wait 90 minutes for initial response
   - Back-and-forth diagnostics (5 email exchanges)
   - False lead: "Check your firewall rules" (already verified)

5. **Resolution Discovery** (4 hours):
   - Eventually finds SQL connection pool exhaustion in app config
   - Payment processing has longer transactions, holding connections
   - Connection pool max = 100, peak usage hitting 98-99
   - Solution: Increase connection pool max to 200, add connection timeout handling

6. **Implementation & Validation** (2 hours):
   - Update App Service configuration
   - Deploy configuration change
   - Monitor for 30 minutes → errors continue
   - Realize need app restart to apply config
   - Restart app (brief full outage)
   - Monitor for 60 minutes → errors resolved

7. **Documentation** (2 hours):
   - Write post-mortem (exhausted, 2 AM)
   - Update runbooks
   - Document lessons learned
   - Create prevention recommendations

**Total**: 30 hours over 3-4 days (with breaks for sleep, other duties)

### Why This is Painful

- **Revenue Loss**: $44K already lost, could be $100K+ if takes 3 days
- **Sleep Deprivation**: 2 AM troubleshooting, back online at 8 AM
- **Career Stress**: CEO watching, performance review implications
- **Knowledge Gaps Exposed**: Feels inadequate, imposter syndrome
- **Opportunity Cost**: 30 hours not spent on strategic work (automation, optimization)

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- ✅ Identify root cause within 1 hour (vs. 8 hours manual)
- ✅ Generate diagnostic KQL queries in <3 minutes (vs. 45 minutes manual)
- ✅ Provide solution recommendations with confidence
- ✅ Validate fix and confirm resolution
- ✅ Document incident thoroughly for future reference

### Performance Requirements

- **MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution)**: <6 hours (vs. 30 hours manual)
- **Diagnostic Query Generation**: <3 minutes per query (vs. 30-45 minutes)
- **Solution Identification**: <2 hours (vs. 8 hours trial-and-error)
- **Documentation**: <30 minutes (vs. 2 hours manual writing)

### Business Outcomes

- **Revenue Protection**: Resolve before losing $100K+
- **SLA Preservation**: Minimize downtime hours against annual budget
- **Black Friday Readiness**: Confidence that platform is stable
- **Team Confidence**: Sarah feels empowered, not overwhelmed
- **Knowledge Capture**: Next engineer can resolve similar issue in <2 hours

## Stakeholders

### Primary

- **Maya Patel** (On-Call Engineer): Needs fast diagnosis and clear solution
- **Mark Rodriguez** (Engineering Manager): Wants incident resolved and postmortem
- **Customers**: Want to complete purchases, losing patience

### Secondary

- **CTO**: Monitoring situation, wants confidence in resolution
- **CEO**: Concerned about Black Friday revenue impact
- **Customer Support Team**: Fielding angry customer calls
- **Development Team**: May need to assist with hotfix (if code-related)

## Risks & Mitigation

### Key Risks

1. **Risk**: Wrong diagnosis → implement ineffective fix
   - **Mitigation**: Copilot-assisted diagnostics reduce false positives
   - **Impact**: High (wastes hours, customer trust erodes)

2. **Risk**: Configuration change causes worse outage
   - **Mitigation**: Use `WhatIf` parameters, test in staging first
   - **Impact**: Critical (100% downtime worse than 15% errors)

3. **Risk**: Issue is external (payment gateway) → limited control
   - **Mitigation**: Identify quickly, implement workaround (failover to backup gateway)
   - **Impact**: Medium (can mitigate with architecture changes)

4. **Risk**: Black Friday hits before resolution
   - **Mitigation**: Aggressive timeline, escalate resources if needed
   - **Impact**: Catastrophic ($2M+ revenue loss)

## Decision Points

### Hour 1: Triage or Escalate?

**Decision**: Try Copilot-assisted diagnostics first

- If root cause identified in 1 hour → continue resolution
- If still unclear after 1 hour → escalate to vendor support + dev team

### Hour 3: Rollback or Fix Forward?

**Decision**: Depends on root cause

- If recent deployment caused issue → rollback immediately
- If configuration issue → fix forward with targeted change
- If infrastructure scaling → scale up resources

### Hour 5: Go/No-Go for Black Friday

**Decision**: Platform readiness assessment

- If issue resolved + validated → proceed with Black Friday plans
- If intermittent issues remain → implement circuit breaker, feature flag checkouts

## Expected Outcome

### With Copilot (5 Hours)

**Hour 1** (AI-Assisted Triage):

- Copilot generates health check script → runs in 10 minutes
- Identifies SQL Database as suspicious (high connection count)
- Copilot creates KQL query to analyze SQL connection patterns
- Finds: Connection pool exhaustion (98% utilization)

**Hour 2** (Root Cause Analysis):

- Copilot generates query to correlate with failed requests
- Discovers: Payment processing operations hold connections 3× longer than other operations
- Copilot suggests: "Check application connection pool settings"
- Sarah reviews app config → finds `maxPoolSize=100` (default, too low)

**Hour 3** (Solution Implementation):

- Copilot generates remediation script to update app config
- Suggests: Increase to 200, add connection timeout, add retry logic
- Sarah deploys config change + restarts app
- Monitors with Copilot-generated dashboard query

**Hour 4** (Validation):

- Error rate drops from 15% → 0% within 15 minutes
- Copilot query confirms: Connection pool now 45% utilization (healthy)
- No customer complaints in past 30 minutes
- Performance metrics return to baseline

**Hour 5** (Documentation):

- Copilot generates incident post-mortem with timeline
- Includes: Root cause, resolution steps, prevention recommendations
- Sarah reviews, adds context, shares with team

**Result**: Issue resolved, Black Friday confidence restored, Sarah is a hero

### Without Copilot (30 Hours)

See "Troubleshooting Challenges" section above for detailed breakdown.

**Result**: Issue resolved eventually, but at significant cost (revenue, stress, opportunity)
