# SkillsMatrix - Operator Competency Tracking

**Purpose:** Track who can run what, plan training, ensure coverage, support IATF 16949 compliance.

## When to Activate

- "Who can run the NLX2500?"
- "Create training matrix"
- "What machines is Dave trained on?"
- "Do we have backup for Swiss?"
- "Training needs for new hire"
- "Competency gap analysis"

---

## IATF 16949 Requirements

### Clause 7.2 - Competence

> The organization shall determine necessary competence, ensure competence based on education/training/experience, take actions to acquire competence, and retain documented evidence.

### Required Documentation

1. **Competency definitions** - What skills needed per role
2. **Training records** - Evidence of training completed
3. **Competency assessment** - Verification of capability
4. **Ongoing effectiveness** - Periodic revalidation
