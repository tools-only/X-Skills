# Customer Advocacy Programs Skill

## When to Use
- Building a new references or case study engine.
- Standing up advisory boards, councils, or community spotlights.
- Refreshing incentives, logistics, or measurement for existing advocacy motions.

## Framework
1. **Candidate Pool** – identify accounts by health, persona, usage, sentiment, ARR.
2. **Value Exchange** – clarify why customers would participate (access, insights, promotion, perks).
3. **Program Design** – define format (case study, event, video, advisory board) with cadence and deliverables.
4. **Logistics** – NDAs, approvals, briefing docs, gifting, scheduling, speaker prep.
5. **Measurement** – track influence on pipeline, product feedback volume, PR reach, community growth.

## Templates
- Advocate scoring sheet + roster.
- Program brief outline (objectives, stakeholders, content needs, incentives).
- Activation checklist (outreach → prep → execution → follow-up).

## Tips
- Keep a single source of truth for advocate status to avoid overuse.
- Align incentives with procurement/compliance early (gift cards vs swag vs donations).
- Document quotes/approvals centrally so sales/PR can reuse quickly.
