## Demo Best Practices

2. **Agenda** (1 min): Set expectations
3. **Value demo** (15-20 min): Show, don't tell
4. **Objections** (5-10 min): Address concerns
5. **Next steps** (2 min): Confirm action items

### Tips
- Demo to their use case, not features
- Pause for questions frequently
- Use their data/examples when possible
- Have backup demos ready for technical issues
- Record for stakeholders who can't attend
