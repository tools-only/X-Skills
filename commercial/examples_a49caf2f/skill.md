# Creative Thinking Worked Examples

## APPLY Mode Example 1: First Principles

### Context
Logistics startup trying to compete with established players on delivery speed.

### Request
"We need creative ideas to deliver packages faster than competitors"

---

## Creative Exploration: Faster Delivery

### Challenge Reframe
- Original: "How to deliver packages faster?"
- Reframed: "How to minimize time between order and customer having what they need?"

### Technique Applied: First Principles

**Step 1: List Assumptions**
| Assumption | Challenge |
|------------|-----------|
| We ship physical packages | Does customer need physical item? |
| Items come from warehouse | Must origin be centralized? |
| Drivers deliver to addresses | Must delivery be to home? |
| Customers wait for delivery | Must they wait? |
| One package per delivery | Must trips be single-purpose? |

**Step 2: Fundamental Truths**
- Customer wants outcome, not necessarily physical item
- Items exist in many locations (stores, other customers)
- Vehicles already moving everywhere constantly
- Most deliveries go to same neighborhoods repeatedly

**Step 3: Rebuild from Truths**

### Ideas Generated

1. **Instant Digital Fulfillment**
   - Mechanism: For eligible items, deliver digital version instantly, physical follows
   - Novel element: Immediate gratification + physical backup
   - Example: Order book → instant e-book access, physical ships normally

2. **Crowd-Sourced Last Mile**
   - Mechanism: Anyone going "that direction" can deliver for payment
   - Novel element: Use existing movement, not dedicated drivers
   - Example: Commuter picks up package at hub, drops at address on way home

3. **Hyperlocal Inventory Network**
   - Mechanism: Stock popular items in micro-warehouses (apartments, stores)
   - Novel element: Inventory within 10 minutes of every address
   - Example: Partner with corner stores as package pickup and mini-inventory

4. **Predictive Pre-Positioning**
   - Mechanism: AI predicts orders, pre-positions inventory in delivery vehicles
   - Novel element: Package in neighborhood before order placed
   - Example: Trucks circulate with predicted orders; delivery in 10 min of order

5. **Outcome-as-a-Service**
   - Mechanism: Don't ship item; provide the outcome locally
   - Novel element: Eliminate delivery entirely for some needs
   - Example: Need drill? Partner with local tool library; tool arrives, not purchase

### Combinations Worth Exploring
- Hyperlocal + Crowd-sourced → Neighbors deliver from local micro-warehouse
- Predictive + Digital → Digital instant, physical pre-positioned

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Pilot "Hyperlocal Inventory Network" in one dense neighborhood
2. Test demand prediction accuracy before "Predictive Pre-Positioning"
3. Explore "Outcome-as-a-Service" for tool/equipment category

## APPLY Mode Example 2: SCAMPER

### Context
Fitness app with plateauing user engagement.

### Request
"Generate ideas to make our fitness app more engaging"

---

## Creative Exploration: Fitness App Engagement

### Challenge Reframe
- Original: "Make app more engaging"
- Reframed: "Make fitness itself more engaging through the app"

### Technique Applied: SCAMPER

**S — Substitute**
| Current | Substitute | Idea |
|---------|------------|------|
| Tracking your own workouts | Track against a rival | Ghost competition: race against yesterday's you |
| Human trainers | AI coach | Adaptive AI that learns your response to motivation |
| Visual progress | Audio progress | Podcast-style coaching during workout |
| Manual logging | Automatic detection | Phone sensors auto-detect exercise type |

**C — Combine**
| Element 1 | Element 2 | Combination |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Fitness app | Music streaming | Workout = unlocks new music; BPM-matched playlists |
| Fitness app | Audiobook | Story progresses only while exercising |
| Fitness tracking | Charity | Steps = donations to chosen cause |
| Social fitness | Gaming | Fitness RPG: workouts level up your character |

**A — Adapt**
| From Domain | Adapted Concept |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Duolingo | Streak protection, daily XP, leagues, leaderboards |
| Strava | Segment competitions, KOMs for local routes |
| Peloton | Live classes with real-time leaderboard |
| Pokemon GO | AR elements, collect "fit creatures" at workout spots |

**M — Modify/Magnify/Minify**
| Modification | Idea |
|--------------|------|
| Magnify social | Workout parties: 10 friends, same workout, same time |
| Magnify consequences | Commitment contracts: pay if you miss goals |
| Minify workouts | 5-minute micro-workouts throughout day |
| Modify visibility | Only friends see your "struggle" workouts (authenticity) |

**P — Put to Other Uses**
| Other Use | Idea |
|-----------|------|
| Dating app | Match with fitness partners; workout = date |
| Insurance | Connect to health insurance for premium discounts |
| Corporate wellness | B2B team fitness challenges |
| Mental health | Mood tracking + exercise correlation insights |

**E — Eliminate**
| Eliminate | Idea |
|-----------|------|
| The app during workout | "Unplug mode": app rewards phone-free workouts |
| Complexity | Single metric: "fitness score" (not 50 stats) |
| Individual focus | Pure team-based: your score = team's average |
| Tracking | "Feel-based" logging: just rate how you felt |

**R — Reverse/Rearrange**
| Reversal | Idea |
|----------|------|
| App motivates you | You motivate others (coaching mode) |
| You follow program | Program follows you (fully adaptive) |
| Track what you did | Track what you'll do (commitment-first) |
| See your progress | Hide progress, reveal monthly (surprise element) |

### Top 5 Ideas to Develop

1. **Zombies, Run! Model (Combine: Story + Exercise)**
   - Narrative progresses only during workouts
   - Cliffhangers motivate next workout
   - Partnership with fiction authors/podcasters

2. **Fitness RPG (Adapt: Gaming)**
   - Your character levels up with real workouts
   - Equipment unlocked by exercise types
   - Boss battles = workout challenges

3. **Commitment Contracts (Modify: Consequences)**
   - Stake money on fitness goals
   - Miss goal → money goes to anti-charity or friend
   - Leverages loss aversion

4. **Micro-Workout Mode (Minify)**
   - 5-minute workouts throughout day
   - 6 × 5 min = 30 min total, but achievable
   - Notification-based prompts

5. **Coach Mode (Reverse)**
   - Users coach each other
   - Social accountability + status from helping
   - Coaches more engaged than coached

## AUDIT Mode Example

### Context
Startup founder has idea for "AI-powered personal stylist that uses your existing wardrobe"

---

## Idea Audit: AI Wardrobe Stylist

**Score:** 12/18 | **Verdict:** Promising

### Concept Summary
Mobile app that photographs user's existing clothes, uses AI to suggest outfits, learns preferences, and recommends purchases that complement existing wardrobe.

### Dimension Scores

| Dimension | Score | Assessment |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Originality | 2/3 | Similar apps exist (Cladwell, Stylebook) but AI-first approach is differentiated |
| Feasibility | 3/3 | Technology exists (image recognition, recommendation systems); mobile app is proven format |
| Value | 2/3 | Real problem (decision fatigue, unused clothes) but "vitamin not painkiller" |
| Clarity | 3/3 | Crystal clear: "AI picks your outfit from your closet" — instantly understood |
| Defensibility | 1/3 | Low moat; any company with AI capability could copy; data moat possible over time |
| Scalability | 3/3 | Pure software; network effects possible if social features added |

### Strengths
- Very clear value proposition
- Technically feasible today
- Mobile-first approach fits user behavior
- Potential for commerce integration (affiliate revenue)
- Data asset grows with usage

### Gaps
- **Defensibility is weak**: What prevents Instagram/Pinterest/Amazon from adding this?
- **Value is "nice to have"**: Not solving urgent pain; more lifestyle enhancement
- **Existing competition**: Cladwell, Stylebook, Chicisimo have traction
- **Behavior change required**: Users must photograph entire wardrobe (high activation energy)

### Enhancement Recommendations

1. **Increase Defensibility**
   - Build network effects: Social outfit sharing, following stylish users
   - Exclusive brand partnerships for recommendations
   - Proprietary style algorithm trained on unique data

2. **Increase Value**
   - Target higher-stakes moments: Job interviews, dates, important meetings
   - Add "cost per wear" tracking (show value of underused items)
   - "Capsule wardrobe" feature to reduce decision fatigue permanently

3. **Reduce Activation Friction**
   - Partner with dry cleaners/laundry services who photograph clothes
   - Import from e-commerce purchase history
   - "Quick start" with just 10 items, not entire wardrobe

4. **Revenue Model**
   - Affiliate commissions on recommended purchases
   - Subscription for premium features
   - B2B for personal shoppers/stylists

### Revised Score (with enhancements): 15/18 (Breakthrough potential)

## FIX Mode Example 1: Breaking Creative Block

### Context
Product team brainstormed for 2 hours on "how to increase user activation" and only generated 5 ideas, all incremental improvements to existing onboarding.

---

## Creative Fix: Activation Ideation Block

### Diagnosis
- **Block type:** Einstellung Effect + Narrow Framing
- **Symptom:** Only 5 ideas after 2 hours; all within existing paradigm
- **Root cause:** Problem framed as "improve onboarding" — implicitly constrains solution to onboarding changes. Team expertise in current product creates blindness.

### Technique Applied: Constraint Manipulation + Analogical Transfer

**Step 1: Remove Constraints**
| Current Constraint | Removed | New Possibilities |
|--------------------|---------|-------------------|
| Users must go through onboarding | What if no onboarding? | Product usable without setup |
| We teach users | What if users teach us? | User tells us their goal, we configure |
| Onboarding is in the app | What if before the app? | Email course before first login |
| Users activate themselves | What if we activate for them? | Concierge setup service |

**Step 2: Analogical Transfer**

| Domain | How They Activate | Transfer Idea |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|
| Video games | Playable tutorial level | Sandbox mode with sample data |
| Uber | First ride free | First outcome free (we do it for them) |
| Duolingo | Placement test | Diagnostic: what do you already know? |
| Netflix | Profile creation = personalization | Show personalized value before any work |
| Amazon | One-click buying | One-click workspace setup |

### Before
5 ideas, all onboarding variations:
1. Reduce onboarding steps
2. Add progress bar
3. Tooltips on key features
4. Video tutorial option
5. Skip button for advanced users

### After
15+ ideas across multiple paradigms:

**No-Onboarding Ideas:**
1. **Pre-populated workspace**: Sign up, workspace already has sample project
2. **Magic link activation**: Email link that logs you in with basic config done
3. **Learn-by-doing**: No tutorial; first task is building something real (guided)

**Reverse-Onboarding Ideas:**
4. **Tell us your goal**: Single question, we configure for that goal
5. **Import and go**: Connect existing tool, we replicate their setup
6. **Watch us work**: Video of us using the product for their use case

**Before-App Ideas:**
7. **Email course**: 3-day email course teaching core concepts before login
8. **Quiz + personalization**: Assessment determines which features matter to them
9. **Community onboarding**: Join Slack/Discord, learn from peers

**Concierge Ideas:**
10. **White-glove setup**: Specialist sets up their account via call
11. **First project done-for-you**: We complete their first project, they learn by reviewing
12. **Buddy system**: Pair with experienced user for first week

**Outcome-First Ideas:**
13. **Instant value**: Show personalized insight from their data before any setup
14. **Reverse trial**: Full product free; pay to keep what you built
15. **Template gallery**: Start from template 90% like their need

### What Changed
- **Problem reframe**: "Improve onboarding" → "Get users to value faster"
- **Constraint removal**: Revealed assumption that onboarding must exist
- **Analogical transfer**: Borrowed activation patterns from other domains
- **Quantity increased**: 5 → 15+ ideas
- **Paradigm diversity**: Multiple solution categories, not one

## FIX Mode Example 2: Strengthening Weak Idea

### Context
Idea: "Social network for book lovers"

Initial audit score: 6/18 (Weak)
- Originality: 1 (Goodreads exists)
- Feasibility: 3
- Value: 1 (Goodreads is "fine")
- Clarity: 2 (generic description)
- Defensibility: 0
- Scalability: 2

---

## Creative Fix: Weak Idea Strengthening

### Diagnosis
- **Weakness:** Low originality and value; direct Goodreads competitor
- **Root cause:** Idea is category ("social network for X") not insight
- **Question:** What's wrong with Goodreads that creates opportunity?

### Technique Applied: Problem-First Reframe + Constraint Addition

**Step 1: Understand Goodreads Problems**
| Goodreads Problem | User Quote |
|-------------------|------------|
| Recommendations are bad | "It keeps suggesting books I'd hate" |
| Reviews are fake/unhelpful | "Can't trust the ratings" |
| Community is generic | "Don't connect with people like me" |
| UI is dated | "Looks like 2005" |
| Amazon-owned = privacy concerns | "Don't want Amazon tracking my reading" |

**Step 2: Pick Specific Problem**
Selected: "Recommendations are bad"

**Step 3: First Principles on Recommendations**
- Goodreads recommends based on genre, ratings, "also bought"
- Misses: Reading mood, life stage, reading pace, taste nuance
- Insight: Reading taste is like music taste — genre is crude; need "vibe"

**Step 4: Rebuild Idea**

### Before
"Social network for book lovers"
- Generic category entry
- No differentiation
- Competing on features (losing game)

### After
**"Spotify for book recommendations"**
- Core insight: Book taste has "vibes" not just genres
- Mechanism: Create "reading taste profile" from books you've loved
- AI matches taste profiles, not genres
- Find "taste twins" — people with same profile
- Their recommendations are gold

**Specific Features:**
1. **Taste profile**: Answer 20 questions → reading personality
2. **Vibe tags**: "Cozy," "Mind-bending," "Heartbreaking," "Escapist"
3. **Taste twins**: Match with readers who share your taste
4. **Twin recommendations**: What are your taste twins reading?
5. **Anti-recommendations**: "Based on your profile, you'd hate this"

### Revised Score: 13/18 (Promising)

| Dimension | Before | After | Change |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Originality | 1 | 2 | Unique angle: taste profiles |
| Feasibility | 3 | 3 | Same |
| Value | 1 | 3 | Solves real pain (bad recs) |
| Clarity | 2 | 3 | "Spotify for book recommendations" |
| Defensibility | 0 | 2 | Taste algorithm + community data |
| Scalability | 2 | 3 | Network effects from taste twins |
| **Total** | **6** | **13** | **+7 points** |

### What Changed
- Started with **problem**, not category
- Added **unique insight** (taste profiles)
- Created **differentiation** (vibes, not genres)
- Built **defensibility** (proprietary algorithm + community)
- Sharpened **clarity** (one-line pitch)
