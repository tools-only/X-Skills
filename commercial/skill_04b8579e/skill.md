## Writing Framework

### Document Structure Template
```
1. HEADER

5. MATERIALS & EQUIPMENT
   - Parts/components list
   - Tools required
   - Equipment specifications
   - Gages and measuring devices

6. PROCEDURE/STEPS
   - Sequential numbered steps
   - Action-oriented language (verb-first)
   - Visual aids (photos, diagrams)
   - Quality checks embedded

7. QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
   - Specifications and tolerances
   - Inspection frequency
   - Acceptance/rejection criteria
   - Rework procedures

8. RECORDS & DOCUMENTATION
   - What gets recorded
   - Where records stored
   - Retention requirements

9. REFERENCES
   - Related documents
   - Engineering drawings
   - Specifications
   - Standards

10. REVISION HISTORY
    - Date, revision, changes made
```

## Process Type Guidelines

### Assembly Operations
- **Focus**: Sequence, torque specs, orientation
- **Include**: Part numbers, installation direction, fastener specifications
- **Visuals**: Assembly diagrams, before/after photos, exploded views
- **Checks**: Fit, alignment, function tests

### Machining Operations
- **Focus**: Setup, program, tooling, parameters
- **Include**: Machine settings, feed/speed, tool specifications, fixtures
- **Visuals**: Setup photos, tool paths, measurement points
- **Checks**: Dimensional verification, surface finish, first-piece inspection

### Quality/Inspection
- **Focus**: What to inspect, how to measure, accept/reject criteria
- **Include**: Gage R&R references, sampling plans, measurement methods
- **Visuals**: Measurement locations, gage usage, defect examples
- **Checks**: Calibration verification, data recording

### Material Handling
- **Focus**: Movement, storage, protection, traceability
- **Include**: Handling methods, storage conditions, labeling, FIFO
- **Visuals**: Packaging methods, storage layouts, label formats
- **Checks**: Condition verification, count accuracy, traceability

## Best Practices

### Writing Style
- **Active voice**: "Insert the bolt" not "The bolt is inserted"
- **Present tense**: "Check the torque" not "The torque should be checked"
- **Imperative mood**: Direct commands to operator
- **Concise**: One action per step
- **Specific**: Exact values, not ranges when possible

### Visual Elements
- Photos of actual parts/processes (preferred)
- Diagrams for complex assemblies
- Flowcharts for decision points
- Callouts for critical features
- Color coding for emphasis (warnings in red/yellow)

### Quality Integration
- Embed quality checks within process steps
- Reference control plans
- Link to FMEA high-priority items
- Include mistake-proofing (poka-yoke) features
- Document inspection frequency

### Revision Control
- Clear document numbering system
- Revision history table
- Change bars for modified sections
- Effective date tracking
- Training requirements for changes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Assuming operator knowledge
- Missing safety information
- Vague quantities or specifications
- No visual aids for complex operations
- Incomplete tool/equipment lists
- Missing quality acceptance criteria
- No revision history
- Passive voice or unclear instructions

## Integration with Related Skills

### A3CriticalThinking
When manufacturing issues arise, use A3 problem-solving methodology:
- Quality defects → Root cause analysis (5 Whys, Fishbone)
- Process failures → Structured countermeasure development
- Decision making → Apply priority hierarchy (Safety → Customer → Cost)

**Load A3 skill:** `read ~/.claude/skills/A3CriticalThinking/SKILL.md`

### SupplyChain
For supplier-related documentation and requirements:
- Supplier quality requirements in work instructions
- PPAP documentation for purchased components
- Incoming inspection procedures

**Load SupplyChain skill:** `read ~/.claude/skills/SupplyChain/SKILL.md`

### HoshinKanri
For strategic alignment of manufacturing objectives:
- Cascade targets to shop floor metrics
- Link work instructions to quality objectives
- Bowling chart for manufacturing KPIs

**Load HoshinKanri skill:** `read ~/.claude/skills/HoshinKanri/SKILL.md`

## Key Principles

**Priority Hierarchy (from A3CriticalThinking):**
```
1. SAFETY FIRST     → Never compromise for cost or delivery
2. CUSTOMER VALUE   → Quality that meets/exceeds requirements
3. SHAREHOLDER VALUE → Optimize after 1 & 2 are secured
```

1. **Safety First**: Always lead with safety considerations - this is non-negotiable
2. **Clarity Over Brevity**: Be clear, even if it takes more words
3. **Visual Communication**: A picture is worth 1000 words
4. **Measurable Requirements**: Specific, measurable acceptance criteria
5. **Traceability**: Link to higher-level documents and standards
6. **Living Documents**: Build in revision and improvement processes
7. **Problem Solving**: Use A3 methodology for issues and improvements
