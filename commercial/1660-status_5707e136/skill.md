# /conductor:status — Current Project Status

Display the current progress across all tracks and the active evaluate-loop state.

## Usage

```bash
/conductor:status
```

## What It Shows

- **Active Track** — Which track is currently in progress
- **Current Step** — Where in the Evaluate-Loop we are
- **Tasks** — Completed vs remaining count
- **Last Agent** — Which agent ran last and its result
- **Next Action** — What to run next

## Your Task

Read the following files to generate the status report:

1. **`conductor/tracks.md`** — List of all tracks and their statuses
2. **Active track's `metadata.json`** — Current loop step and state
3. **Active track's `plan.md`** — Task completion progress

## Output Format

```
## Conductor Status

**Active Track**: my-feature-implementation
**Current Step**: Execute (Step 3 of 5)
**Tasks**: 8/12 completed (4 remaining)
**Last Agent**: loop-executor (2 tasks completed, commit abc1234)
**Superpower Enhanced**: Yes
**Fix Cycles**: 0

### Pending Tasks
- [ ] Task 2.3: Add error handling
- [ ] Task 2.4: Write unit tests
- [ ] Task 3.1: Update documentation
- [ ] Task 3.2: Final integration check

### Next Action
