# Activation Map Skill

## When to Use
- After defining new customer segments or insights that require action.
- Aligning marketing, sales, CS, and product teams on who owns what.
- Tracking adoption and performance of segment-driven campaigns.

## Framework
1. **Segment/Insight Summary** – describe target segments, size, and business goal.
2. **Play Mapping** – list recommended plays (campaign, nurture, CS program, product change) with owners.
3. **Channel & Asset Needs** – specify content, tooling, and integrations required.
4. **Measurement** – define KPIs, dashboards, and review cadence.
5. **Feedback Loop** – gather learnings, update plays, and inform next iteration.

## Templates
- Activation matrix (segment, play, owner, timing, KPI).
- Brief template for play owners.
- Scorecard format for exec reviews.

## Tips
- Keep owners accountable by including due dates and status fields.
- Tie KPIs back to the original segmentation goal for clarity.
- Pair with `segmentation-framework` updates to maintain alignment.
