## Tips for Filling

1. **Use sticky notes** - One idea per note, easy to move
2. **Be specific** - Avoid vague statements
3. **Customer language** - Use words they would use
4. **Multiple canvases** - One per segment if needed
5. **Iterate** - First draft won't be perfect
6. **Test assumptions** - Validate with customers
