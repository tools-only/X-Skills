## Description

As a validator, I want to get the "clean" text of a PDF file to compare it with EPUB chunks.
 As a developer, I want to know if extraction failed due to encryption or corrupted file structure.
 As a system, I want to handle PDF files with bookmarks and TOC (optional/future).

**Tags:** `commercial`
