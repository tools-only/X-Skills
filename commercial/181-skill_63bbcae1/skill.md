# Adoption Playbook Skill

## When to Use
- Launching onboarding/adoption initiatives for new segments or products.
- Refreshing adoption strategies after major roadmap or packaging changes.
- Standardizing enablement for CS, product, and marketing partnerships.

## Framework
1. **Persona & Journey Mapping** – goals, blockers, success metrics, critical milestones.
2. **Play Matrix** – channel x milestone view of actions, owners, cadences, and triggers.
3. **Content Library** – templates for comms, workshops, office hours, and enablement assets.
4. **Measurement Plan** – activation, usage, sentiment, expansion metrics with thresholds.
5. **Feedback Loop** – qualitative signals, experiment backlog, and improvement tracker.

## Templates
- Journey table (milestone, trigger, action, owner, KPI).
- Adoption campaign brief with creative/copy checklist.
- Weekly adoption standup agenda and notes doc.

## Tips
- Anchor each milestone on a clear customer outcome, not just feature usage.
- Pair with `build-adoption-program` command for automated blueprints.
- Archive playbook iterations to show impact in QBR/EBR storytelling.
