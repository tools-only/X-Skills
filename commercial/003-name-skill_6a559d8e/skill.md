# SEO Technical: Crawlability

Guides crawlability improvements: robots, X-Robots-Tag, site structure, and internal linking.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1–2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Scope (Technical SEO)

- **Redirect chains & loops**: Fix multi-hop redirects; point directly to final URL
- **Broken links (4xx)**: Fix broken internal/external links; 301 or remove
- **Site architecture**: Logical hierarchy; pages within 3–4 clicks from homepage
- **Orphan pages**: Add internal links to pages with no incoming links
- **Pagination**: Prefer pagination over infinite scroll for crawlability

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:** If `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` or `.cursor/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it for site structure.

Identify:
1. **Site structure**: Flat vs. deep hierarchy
2. **Framework**: Next.js, static, SPA, etc.
3. **Key paths**: Sitemap, robots.txt, API, static assets

## Best Practices

### Redirect Chains & Loops

- Fix multi-hop redirects; point directly to final URL
- Loops: URLs redirecting back to themselves; break the cycle

### Broken Links (4xx)

- Fix broken internal/external links; 301 or remove
- Audit regularly; update or remove broken links

### Site Architecture

| Principle | Guideline |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Depth** | Important pages within 3–4 clicks from homepage |
| **Orphan pages** | Add internal links to pages with no incoming links |
| **Hierarchy** | Logical structure; hub pages link to content |

### Pagination

- Prefer pagination over infinite scroll for crawlability
- Reference links to next/previous pages; avoid dynamic-only loading

## Common Issues

| Issue | Check |
|-------|-------|
| Redirect chains | Update links to point directly to final URL |
| Broken links | 301 or remove; audit internal and external |
| Orphan pages | Add internal links from hub or navigation |
| Infinite scroll | Replace with pagination for key content |

## Output Format

- **Redirect audit**: Chains and loops to fix
- **Broken link audit**: 4xx links to fix
- **Site structure**: Orphan pages, hierarchy
- **Pagination**: Implementation for crawlable content
