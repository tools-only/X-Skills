# Analytics: Traffic

Guides website traffic analysis across all channels (organic, paid, social, referral, direct). Covers traffic source attribution, dark traffic identification, and multi-channel reporting.

**When invoking**: On **first use**, if helpful, open with 1-2 sentences on what this skill covers and why it matters, then provide the main output. On **subsequent use** or when the user asks to skip, go directly to the main output.

## Scope

- **Traffic sources**: Organic, paid, social, referral, direct, email
- **Dark traffic**: Unattributed visits labeled as "Direct / None"
- **Attribution**: UTM tagging, segmenting, reporting accuracy

## Traffic Channels

| Channel | Typical Sources | Attribution |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Organic** | Google, Bing, other search | Referrer preserved |
| **Paid** | Google Ads, Meta Ads, etc. | UTM required |
| **Social** | Public posts (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) | Often preserved |
| **Referral** | External sites, backlinks | Referrer preserved |
| **Direct** | Typed URL, bookmarks | No referrer |
| **Email** | Newsletters, campaigns | Often dark without UTM |

## Dark Traffic

### What It Is

Traffic without clear origin--analytics tools default to "Direct" when referrer is missing. Common causes:

- **Private/dark social**: WhatsApp, Messenger, Slack, Discord, TikTok shares
- **Email clients**: Many strip referrer headers
- **HTTPS->HTTP**: Referrer not passed
- **Mobile apps**: In-app browsers often omit referrer
- **Ad blockers, privacy tools**: Block tracking

### Misattribution (Research)

When traffic was sent from known sources, analytics often misattributed:

- **100% as direct**: TikTok, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, Mastodon
- **75%**: Facebook Messenger
- **30%**: Instagram DMs
- **14%**: LinkedIn public posts
- **12%**: Pinterest

### Mitigation

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **UTM parameters** | Tag links in emails, social, campaigns: `?utm_source=X&utm_medium=Y&utm_campaign=Z` |
| **Block internal IPs** | Exclude company visits from reports |
| **Segment direct traffic** | Split by page type to estimate dark vs. genuine direct |

### Segmenting Direct Traffic

1. **Expected direct**: Homepage, short URLs, brand pages--likely real direct
2. **Unexpected direct**: Long URLs, deep pages, product pages--likely dark traffic
3. **Report separately**: Use segments in GA4/analytics to avoid overcounting direct

## UTM Best Practices

| Parameter | Use | Example |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| `utm_source` | Origin | `newsletter`, `facebook`, `google` |
| `utm_medium` | Channel type | `email`, `cpc`, `social` |
| `utm_campaign` | Campaign name | `summer_sale`, `product_launch` |
| `utm_content` | Variant (optional) | `banner_a`, `cta_button` |
| `utm_term` | Paid keyword (optional) | `running_shoes` |

- **Consistent naming**: Lowercase, underscores; document conventions
- **Apply everywhere**: Every link in emails, social posts, ads
- **Avoid**: Typos, inconsistent values; causes fragmentation

## Traffic Diversification

| Principle | Guideline |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Search share** | Keep organic search below ~75% of total traffic |
| **Health** | Higher direct + referral share = healthier profile |
| **Brand sites** | Diversified traffic is common for strong brands |
| **Engagement** | Content, email, social, free tools drive return visits |

1. Review organic traffic trend
2. Record baseline (e.g., monthly total)
3. Compare periodically to detect growth or decline
