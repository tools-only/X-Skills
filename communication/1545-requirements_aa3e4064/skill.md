# S08: Coding Agent - Business Requirements

## Customer Profile

**Organization:** Contoso Healthcare
**Industry:** Healthcare
**Size:** Mid-market (500 employees, 10,000 patients)
**Azure Maturity:** Intermediate (existing Azure footprint, IaC adoption in progress)

---

## Business Context

Contoso Healthcare recently deployed a new patient portal infrastructure using Azure
Bicep templates. The deployment was successful, but the operations team has identified
a critical gap: **no monitoring or alerting is configured**.

### Current State

- Patient portal infrastructure deployed to Azure
- App Service, SQL Database, Key Vault, Storage all operational
- Log Analytics workspace exists but no alert rules
- Zero visibility into application health
- Operations team relies on user complaints to identify issues

### Problem Statement

> "We deployed the patient portal last week, and it's working great—but we have no
> idea if it's about to fail. If the database fills up or the app runs out of memory,
> we won't know until patients start calling. That's not acceptable for healthcare."
>
> — Alex Petrov, Cloud Operations Engineer

| ----- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| FR-01 | Alert when App Service CPU exceeds threshold    | High     |
| FR-02 | Alert when App Service memory exceeds threshold | High     |
| FR-03 | Alert when HTTP 5xx errors spike                | High     |
| FR-04 | Alert when response time degrades               | Medium   |
| FR-05 | Send email notifications for all alerts         | High     |
| FR-06 | Configurable alert thresholds                   | Medium   |
| FR-07 | Ability to disable alerts per environment       | Low      |

### Non-Functional Requirements

| ID     | Requirement       | Details                                       |
| ------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| NFR-01 | Code quality      | Must pass `bicep build` and `bicep lint`      |
| NFR-02 | Maintainability   | Follow existing code patterns and conventions |
| NFR-03 | Documentation     | README must document alert configuration      |
| NFR-04 | Region compliance | Use swedencentral (EU data residency)         |
| NFR-05 | Tagging           | Include Environment, ManagedBy, Project tags  |

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- Must integrate with existing Bicep modules (not standalone deployment)
- Must use existing Log Analytics workspace (no new workspace)
- Alert thresholds must be parameterized for environment flexibility
- Module must follow CAF naming conventions

### Business Constraints

- Implementation needed before Friday go-live (3 days)
- Operations team has limited Bicep expertise
- No budget for third-party monitoring tools
- Must work within existing Azure subscription limits

### Compliance Constraints

- HIPAA: Audit trail required for all infrastructure changes
- Change management: All changes via Pull Request review
- EU GDPR: Data must remain in EU region

---

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (MVP)

- [ ] 4 alert rules operational in Azure
- [ ] Email notifications working
- [ ] Zero `bicep build` errors
- [ ] Integrated into existing main.bicep

### Should Have

- [ ] README documentation updated
- [ ] Alert thresholds configurable via parameters
- [ ] Module follows existing patterns

### Nice to Have

- [ ] Environment-specific alert tuning
- [ ] Additional alert types (SQL, Storage)
- [ ] Dashboard for alert visualization
