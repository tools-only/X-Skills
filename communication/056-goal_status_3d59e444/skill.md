I don't see any data or goals provided in your message. To create a comparison table of metrics against goals, I would need:

1. **Current metrics** - What are the actual performance numbers?
2. **Stated goals** - What are the target numbers or objectives?
3. **Time period** - What timeframe are we measuring?

Could you please share:
- The data/metrics you're referring to
- The goals you want to compare against
- Any relevant context (department, project, time period, etc.)

Once you provide this information, I'll be happy to create a markdown table showing the status (On Track/At Risk/Behind) and gaps for each goal.
