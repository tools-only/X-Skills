# Goal Setting Frameworks

## OKR (Objectives and Key Results)

**Use when:** Company/team goal setting, aligning efforts, measuring outcomes

### Structure

```
Objective: What we want to achieve (qualitative, inspirational)
├─ Key Result 1: How we measure success (quantitative, measurable)
├─ Key Result 2: Another measurable outcome
└─ Key Result 3: Third measurable outcome
```

### Rules

| Element | Characteristics |
|---------|----------------|
| **Objective** | Inspirational, qualitative, action-oriented, time-bound (quarterly) |
| **Key Results** | Measurable, specific, 2-5 per objective, outcome-focused (not tasks) |

### Grading Scale

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0.0-0.3 | Failed to make progress |
| 0.4-0.6 | Made progress but fell short |
| 0.7-0.9 | Delivered (sweet spot for stretch goals) |
| 1.0 | Fully achieved (goal may have been too easy) |

### Example: ThepExcel Q1 OKR

```markdown
## Objective: Become the #1 AI+Excel learning platform in Thailand

### Key Results:
1. Increase monthly active users from 10K to 25K
   - Current: 10K → Target: 25K → Score: ___

2. Launch 5 new AI-focused courses with >4.5 star ratings
   - Current: 0 → Target: 5 → Score: ___

3. Achieve 40% course completion rate (up from 25%)
   - Current: 25% → Target: 40% → Score: ___
```

### OKR Cadence

| Timeframe | Activity |
|-----------|----------|
| **Quarterly** | Set new OKRs, review previous quarter |
| **Monthly** | Check-in meeting, assess progress |
| **Weekly** | Quick status update, identify blockers |

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Key Results are tasks | Focus on outcomes, not activities |
| Too many OKRs | Max 3-5 objectives, 3-5 KRs each |
| Sandbagging (too easy) | Aim for 70% achievement rate |
| No regular check-ins | Weekly/bi-weekly reviews |
| Tied to compensation | Separate from bonuses (encourages stretch) |

## SMART Goals

**Use when:** Individual goals, project milestones, clear deliverables

### The Five Criteria

| Letter | Meaning | Question |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **S** | Specific | What exactly will you accomplish? |
| **M** | Measurable | How will you know when it's done? |
| **A** | Achievable | Is it realistic with available resources? |
| **R** | Relevant | Does it align with broader objectives? |
| **T** | Time-bound | When will it be completed? |

### Template

```markdown
## SMART Goal

**Goal Statement:** [One sentence describing the goal]

- **Specific:** [What, who, where, why]
- **Measurable:** [Metrics, KPIs, evidence of completion]
- **Achievable:** [Resources, skills, constraints considered]
- **Relevant:** [Connection to larger objectives]
- **Time-bound:** [Deadline, milestones]
```

### Example

**Weak:** "Improve customer satisfaction"

**SMART:** "Increase customer NPS score from 45 to 60 by implementing a new support ticketing system and training 5 support staff by March 31, 2025"

### SMART vs OKR

| Aspect | SMART | OKR |
|--------|-------|-----|
| **Scope** | Individual/Project | Team/Company |
| **Ambition** | Achievable (100%) | Stretch (70% target) |
| **Structure** | Single goal | Objective + Key Results |
| **Cadence** | Variable | Quarterly |
| **Best for** | Personal development, projects | Organizational alignment |

## Balanced Scorecard

**Use when:** Comprehensive performance measurement, strategy execution

### Four Perspectives

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │    Financial    │
                    │  "How do we     │
                    │ look to owners?"│
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
    ┌─────────────────┐      │      ┌─────────────────┐
    │    Customer     │◄─────┴─────►│ Internal Process│
    │ "How do customers"     │      │ "What must we   │
    │   see us?"      │             │  excel at?"     │
    └─────────────────┘             └─────────────────┘
                             │
                    ┌────────┴────────┐
                    │ Learning & Growth│
                    │  "How can we    │
                    │ continue to     │
                    │ improve?"       │
                    └─────────────────┘
```

### Metrics by Perspective

| Perspective | Example Metrics |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Financial** | Revenue growth, Profit margin, ROI, Cash flow |
| **Customer** | NPS, Retention rate, Market share, Satisfaction |
| **Internal Process** | Cycle time, Quality rate, Efficiency, Throughput |
| **Learning & Growth** | Employee satisfaction, Training hours, Innovation rate |

### Implementation

1. **Define strategy** - Clarify vision and strategic objectives
2. **Identify objectives** - 3-5 per perspective
3. **Select measures** - 1-2 KPIs per objective
4. **Set targets** - Specific goals for each measure
5. **Plan initiatives** - Actions to achieve targets
6. **Review regularly** - Monthly/quarterly reviews

### Simplified for SME

For smaller organizations, use a **mini Balanced Scorecard**:

| Perspective | 1-2 Key Metrics |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Financial | Revenue, Profit margin |
| Customer | NPS or retention rate |
| Process | One key efficiency metric |
| Growth | Employee engagement or skill development |
