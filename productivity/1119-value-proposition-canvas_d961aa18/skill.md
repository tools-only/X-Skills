# Value Proposition Canvas (VPC)

Created by Alexander Osterwalder, an extension of the Business Model Canvas. Published in "Value Proposition Design" (2014).

## Canvas Structure

The VPC zooms into two blocks of the Business Model Canvas:
- Customer Segments → **Customer Profile**
- Value Propositions → **Value Map**

| **Product-Market Fit** | Evidence customers want your solution | Customers pay, return, refer |
| **Business Model Fit** | Evidence of scalable, profitable model | Unit economics work |

### Fit Checklist

- [ ] Value proposition addresses most important jobs
- [ ] Value proposition addresses most severe pains
- [ ] Value proposition creates essential gains
- [ ] Customers willing to pay for the value
- [ ] Value is differentiated from alternatives

## Tips for Using VPC

1. **One segment at a time** - Create separate canvas for each segment
2. **Customer interviews first** - Don't guess, ask
3. **Rank everything** - Not all jobs/pains/gains are equal
4. **Focus on important** - Address top 3, not all
5. **Iterate** - Update based on feedback
6. **Connect to BMC** - VPC feeds into value proposition block
