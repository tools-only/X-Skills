## Scaffolding & Zone of Proximal Development

### Core Concept

The **ZPD** (Vygotsky) is the gap between what a learner can do alone and what they can do with guidance. All coaching should target this zone.

```
Too Easy (bored) ← | ZPD (learning happens here) | → Too Hard (frustrated)
```

### Productive vs. Unproductive Struggle

| Dimension | Productive | Unproductive |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Goal** | Clear destination, unclear path | Both unclear |
| **Engagement** | Still trying, asking questions | Silent, complaining, checked out |
| **Difficulty** | Just beyond current ability | Completely out of reach |
| **Articulation** | Can say what they're trying to do | Can't articulate what they're stuck on |

**Quick test:** Ask "Can you tell me what you're trying to achieve?"
- If they articulate the goal but not the method → productive (let them struggle)
- If they can't articulate either → unproductive (intervene)

### Scaffolding Techniques

| Technique | When to Use |
|-----------|------------|
| **Questioning** | Learner has the knowledge but isn't connecting it |
| **Hints** (graduated) | Close but stuck on one step |
| **Decomposition** | Problem feels overwhelming as a whole |
| **Analogies** | Concept is abstract or unfamiliar |
| **Modeling** (think-aloud) | No starting point at all |
| **Worked examples** | Needs a template, not an answer |

### Fading

Scaffolding is temporary by definition. Gradually reduce support:

```
Session 1: Model + guide + verify
Session 2: Guide + verify
Session 3: Verify only
Session 4: Learner works independently
```

**Anti-patterns:**
- **Premature rescue** — jumping in at first hesitation → trains helplessness
- **Permanent scaffold** — never fading → learner never builds independence
- **Over-scaffolding** — removing all difficulty → eliminates productive struggle
- **Under-scaffolding** — "figure it out yourself" → not coaching
- **Wrong scaffold** — helping with execution when the gap is in understanding

### Just-in-Time vs. Just-in-Case

- **Just-in-time** (preferred): Wait until learner shows signs of need, then provide targeted support
- **Just-in-case** (avoid): Pre-emptively explaining everything robs the chance for productive struggle

> Manu Kapur's "productive failure" research: struggling BEFORE receiving instruction leads to deeper learning than receiving instruction first.

## Adaptive Questioning

### Open vs. Closed Questions

Neither is superior. Use strategically:

**Closed questions — when:**
- Starting a session (to focus): "On a scale of 1-10, how clear is this?"
- Confirming understanding: "So the issue is X — is that right?"
- Building confidence when overwhelmed (easier to answer)
- Wrapping up: "Will you try X?"

**Open questions — when:**
- Exploring: "What have you tried so far?"
- Deepening: "Why do you think that didn't work?"
- Discovering: "What patterns do you notice?"
- Transferring ownership: "What would you do differently next time?"

**Hybrid technique:** Closed → Open. "Did that work? [closed] ... Tell me more about what happened. [open]"

### Caution: Disguised Advice

"Have you tried X?" is not an open question — it's advice with a question mark. If coaching is non-directive, avoid this pattern.

### The "What, Why, How" Sequence

A practical maieutic prompting framework:
1. "What do you already know about this?"
2. "Why do you think that is?"
3. "How could we test or apply this idea?"

### Contingent Questioning

**Critical:** Don't follow a script. Adapt based on the learner's actual answer.

- If answer is confident and correct → go deeper or move on
- If answer is vague → ask for specifics
- If answer reveals misconception → probe the assumption
- If answer shows emotion → address emotion first

## Emotional Intelligence in Coaching

### Emotions Are Data

| Emotion | Signals | What It Tells You |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Frustration** | "nothing works," blaming language, terse replies, ALL CAPS | Blocked goal — help find the specific block |
| **Overwhelm** | "don't know where to start," scattered description, listing many problems | Exceeded capacity — reduce scope, decompose |
| **Fear** | "this might be stupid but...," perfectionism, excessive validation-seeking | Perceived risk — build safety, normalize difficulty |

### The Validate-Then-Redirect Protocol

```
1. NOTICE  → Pay attention to language patterns, not just content
2. NAME    → "It sounds like this is really frustrating" (tentatively!)
3. NORMALIZE → "That's understandable — most people find this challenging"
4. CHECK   → "Am I reading that right?"
5. BRIDGE  → "Now, would it help to focus on just one piece?"
```

**Critical:** Complete steps 1-4 before step 5. Premature problem-solving fails.

### When to Stay with Emotions vs. Move to Problem-Solving

**Stay with emotions:**
- Person is escalating (increasingly strong language)
- Previous redirect attempts met with resistance
- The emotion itself IS the problem (fear preventing action)

**Move to problem-solving:**
- Person explicitly asks "so what should I do?"
- Emotional intensity has decreased
- They've shifted from venting to seeking solutions

### Anti-Patterns

- **Toxic positivity:** "Just stay positive!" invalidates experience
- **Premature problem-solving:** "Have you tried X?" when they need to be heard
- **Emotional bypassing:** "Let's just focus on the problem" ignores the human
- **Over-validating:** Getting stuck in emotional space without moving forward
- **Diagnosing too confidently:** "You're clearly angry" → use "It sounds like..."
- **Minimizing:** "It's not that hard" dismisses legitimate difficulty
- **Comparison:** "Other people manage this fine" shames rather than motivates

## Growth Mindset Techniques

Based on Carol Dweck's research.

### Core Techniques

| Technique | How | Example |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| **Power of "yet"** | Add "yet" to "I can't" statements | "I can't do X" → "I can't do X *yet*" |
| **Process praise** | Praise strategy and effort, not talent | "Your approach of breaking it down worked well" |
| **Failure as data** | Reframe failed attempts as learning | "What did that attempt teach you?" |
| **Normalize difficulty** | Frame difficulty as growth signal | "If it were easy, you wouldn't be growing" |
| **Model uncertainty** | Show your own growth mindset | "I'm not sure either. Let's figure it out together" |

### Process Praise vs. Talent Praise

| Avoid (talent praise) | Use (process praise) |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| "You're so smart" | "Your strategy of X was effective" |
| "You're a natural" | "I notice you tried 3 different approaches — that persistence pays off" |
| "You'll figure it out, you're brilliant" | "What will you try next?" |

**Why it matters:** Talent praise creates fragility (fear of looking dumb). Process praise builds resilience (effort leads to growth).

### Watch for False Growth Mindset

Dweck warns: saying "I have a growth mindset" while avoiding all challenges = false growth mindset. True growth mindset means genuinely welcoming difficulty.

## Pacing

### When to Slow Down

- Learner gives vague or confused answers
- Emotional signals appear (frustration, self-doubt)
- Problem is complex or novel for the learner
- Learner keeps jumping to solutions without understanding

**How:** Ask simpler questions, acknowledge what's hard, break into smaller pieces

### When to Speed Up

- Learner clearly understands and needs more challenge
- In familiar territory already mastered
- Learner is eager and articulate about next steps
- Goal is review/confirmation, not new learning

**How:** Move to deeper questions, skip obvious steps, raise the challenge

### Adaptive Pacing Signals

| Signal in Text | Pace |
|---------------|------|
| Long detailed thoughtful responses | Match pace — they're engaged |
| Short answers, "I don't know" | Slow down — may need easier entry point |
| "Yeah yeah, I know that" | Speed up — they need more challenge |
| Questions about side topics | They may be avoiding — check emotional state |
| Silence / delayed response | Wait — they may be thinking (or stuck) |
