## Core Decision Biases

### FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)

**Definition**: Anxiety that others are having rewarding experiences you're absent from.

**In Decisions**: Creates urgency where none exists. Makes opportunities seem more unique than they are.

**Counter-questions**:
- What evidence suggests this is truly one-of-a-kind?
- Will similar opportunities exist in the future?
- What's the actual cost of waiting?

**Signs you have it**:
- Feeling rushed to decide
- Imagining others succeeding without you
- Focusing on what you'll miss, not what you'll gain

---

### Sunk Cost Fallacy

**Definition**: Continuing a behavior due to previously invested resources (time, money, effort).

**In Decisions**: Makes you factor past investment into future choices, even when it's irrelevant.

**Counter-questions**:
- If I hadn't invested anything yet, would I start now?
- Is my past investment recoverable by continuing?
- Am I deciding based on future value or past cost?

**Signs you have it**:
- "I've already put in so much..."
- Difficulty abandoning projects you've invested in
- Feeling guilty about "wasted" past effort

---

### Authority Bias

**Definition**: Attributing greater accuracy to opinions of authority figures.

**In Decisions**: Deferring to credentials, status, or famous investors without independent evaluation.

**Counter-questions**:
- Would I trust this advice from someone unknown?
- Does their authority apply to this specific domain?
- What's their actual track record in this area?

**Signs you have it**:
- Mentioning credentials as justification
- Feeling reassured by who's involved, not what's being done
- Not questioning expert opinions

---

### Social Proof

**Definition**: Assuming actions are correct because others are doing them.

**In Decisions**: Following the crowd without evaluating fit for your specific situation.

**Counter-questions**:
- Do these "others" have the same context as me?
- What's the base rate of success for people who did this?
- Would I do this if no one else was?

**Signs you have it**:
- "Everyone is doing it..."
- Drawing confidence from popularity
- Not knowing why it works, just that others say it does

---

### Commitment and Consistency Bias

**Definition**: Desire to appear consistent with what you've already done or said.

**In Decisions**: Feeling obligated by past statements or actions to continue on a path.

**Counter-questions**:
- Has new information emerged since my commitment?
- What would a stranger advise given current facts?
- Is consistency more important than correctness?

**Signs you have it**:
- "But I already said I would..."
- Discomfort with changing your mind
- Feeling like changing course is "breaking a promise"

---

### Optimism Bias

**Definition**: Believing you're less likely to experience negative events than others.

**In Decisions**: Assuming problems will resolve, risks won't materialize, or you're somehow exempt.

**Counter-questions**:
- What's the base rate of this going wrong?
- Why would I be luckier than average?
- What if the problems don't just "work out"?

**Signs you have it**:
- "It'll probably be fine..."
- Dismissing warning signs
- Expecting best-case scenarios without evidence

---

### Recency Bias

**Definition**: Giving more weight to recent events than older ones.

**In Decisions**: Overweighting the last meeting, latest data point, or most recent experience.

**Counter-questions**:
- Does my opinion change based on the order I received information?
- What does the full timeline show?
- Is the recent event representative or anomalous?

**Signs you have it**:
- Strong reaction to latest news
- Forgetting earlier patterns
- "But just last week..."

---

### Confirmation Bias

**Definition**: Seeking information that confirms existing beliefs; avoiding contradicting evidence.

**In Decisions**: Cherry-picking data that supports what you already want to do.

**Counter-questions**:
- What information would make me change my mind?
- Have I actively sought disconfirming evidence?
- Am I interpreting neutral data as supportive?

**Signs you have it**:
- Only reading positive reviews
- Dismissing critics as "not understanding"
- Feeling annoyed by contrary information

---

### Shiny Object Syndrome

**Definition**: Being attracted to new ideas, tools, or opportunities over current commitments.

**In Decisions**: Novelty masquerading as value. Abandoning proven paths for unproven new ones.

**Counter-questions**:
- Is this genuinely better, or just newer?
- Would I pursue this if it had been available all along?
- Am I running toward something or away from something?

**Signs you have it**:
- Excitement about starting, less about finishing
- History of pivoting to "the next thing"
- Current projects feel boring in comparison

---

### Loss Aversion

**Definition**: Preferring avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains.

**In Decisions**: Overweighting what you might lose; underweighting what you might gain.

**Counter-questions**:
- Am I equally weighing gains and losses?
- What's the actual probability of loss?
- What's the opportunity cost of avoiding loss?

**Signs you have it**:
- Focus on downside scenarios
- Feeling protective of current position
- "I can't afford to lose..."

---

## Secondary Biases

### Anchoring

**Definition**: Relying heavily on the first piece of information encountered.

**In Decisions**: First number or offer unduly influences subsequent judgments.

**Counter**: Generate your own estimate before seeing any anchors.

---

### Availability Heuristic

**Definition**: Judging likelihood by how easily examples come to mind.

**In Decisions**: Overestimating risks/opportunities that are memorable or recent.

**Counter**: Look up actual statistics; don't rely on memory.

**In Decisions**: Following trends without independent evaluation.

**Counter**: Ask "Would I do this if no one else was?"

---

### Dunning-Kruger Effect

**In Decisions**: Underestimating difficulty or risk due to inexperience.

**Counter**: Seek opinions from genuine experts in the domain.

---

### Endowment Effect

---

### Halo Effect

**Definition**: Overall impression influences evaluation of specific traits.

**In Decisions**: One positive attribute colors entire assessment.

**Counter**: Evaluate each dimension independently.

---

### Hindsight Bias

**Definition**: After learning outcome, believing you "knew it all along."

**In Decisions**: Overconfidence in predicting future based on explained past.

**Counter**: Document predictions before outcomes are known.

---

### Planning Fallacy

**In Decisions**: Overly optimistic timelines and resource estimates.

**Counter**: Use reference class forecasting; multiply estimates by 1.5-2x.

---

### Status Quo Bias

**Definition**: Preference for the current state of affairs.

**In Decisions**: Inaction feels safer even when action is better.

**Counter**: Evaluate "do nothing" as actively as "do something."
