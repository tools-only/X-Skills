# Health Optimization Skill

## Current Protocols

### Vyvanse Management
- Typical dose: [Update with actual]
- Best taken: Morning, before 10am for optimal evening wind-down
- Duration: ~10-12 hours
- Post-stimulant recovery: Protein, hydration, no caffeine after 2pm

### Supplement Stack
- Morning: [Update with actual stack]
- Evening: [Update with actual stack]
- As needed: [Update with actual stack]

## Workflow Routing
- Vyvanse timing/optimization → Workflows/VyvanseProtocol.md
- Supplement questions → Workflows/SupplementStack.md
- Sleep issues → Workflows/SleepTracking.md
- Energy logging → Workflows/EnergyLog.md

## Patterns to Watch
- Low energy correlates with: poor sleep, late Vyvanse, dehydration
- Best productivity windows: 2-4 hours after Vyvanse
- Recovery needed after: intense focus blocks, late nights

## Quick Interventions

### Low Energy
1. Check hydration (drink 16oz water)
2. Check food (protein in last 3 hours?)
3. Check Vyvanse timing
4. Consider 10-minute walk
5. Power nap if before 2pm

### Can't Focus
1. Is environment optimized? (noise, temp, lighting)
2. Is task clear? (break down if needed)
3. Vyvanse status?
4. Energy state?
5. Try 25-min focused sprint

### Overstimulated
1. Remove stimuli (close tabs, silence notifications)
2. Gentle movement (walk, stretch)
3. Hydrate
4. No more caffeine
5. Consider early wind-down

## Daily Tracking
- Log energy level (1-10) in State/Today.md
- Note Vyvanse timing
- Track sleep hours
- Note any crashes or peaks

## ADHD Context
- External structure > internal willpower
- Environment design matters
- Momentum is everything - protect it
- Recovery is productive, not lazy
