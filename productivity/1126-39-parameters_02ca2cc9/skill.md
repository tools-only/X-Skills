## Tips for Selecting Parameters

1. **Choose the closest match** - If no parameter fits exactly, pick the nearest one
2. **Consider both directions** - The matrix is not symmetrical
3. **Think abstractly** - Parameters apply to any system, not just mechanical
4. **Check related parameters** - Similar parameters may yield different principles
5. **Use multiple pairs** - Complex problems may have multiple contradictions
