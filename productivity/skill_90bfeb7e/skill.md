# Internal Audit

## When to Activate This Skill
- "Plan internal audit programme"
- "Create audit checklist for [process/area]"
- "Conduct process/product/QMS audit"
- "Document audit findings"
- "Write nonconformance report"
- "Plan layered process audit (LPA)"
- "Prepare for IATF 16949 certification audit"

## IATF 16949 Audit Requirements

### Clause 9.2.2.1 - Internal Audit Programme

The organization shall:
- Maintain documented internal audit programme
- Cover all QMS processes over audit cycle (typically 3 years)
- Include customer-specific requirements (CSRs)

- Define audit criteria, scope, frequency, methods

### Types of Internal Audits

| Audit Type | Focus | Frequency | Reference |
|------------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| QMS Audit | Management system conformance | Annual minimum per clause | 9.2.2.2 |
| Process Audit | Manufacturing process effectiveness | Based on risk, min annual | 9.2.2.3 |
| Product Audit | Product conformance | Per control plan, min annual | 9.2.2.4 |
| LPA | Layered process audit | Daily/weekly/monthly | Customer CSR |

## Process Audit (9.2.2.3)

### Purpose
Evaluate effectiveness of manufacturing processes using process approach.

### Scope
Each manufacturing process including:
- Inputs and outputs
- Process controls
- Operator competence
- Equipment capability
- Work instructions compliance

### Approach - Turtle Diagram Method

```
         INPUTS                    OUTPUTS
            ↓                         ↑
    Materials, specs           Products, data
            ↓                         ↑
       ┌─────────────────────────────┐
       │                             │
WITH → │      PROCESS BEING          │ → METRICS
WHAT?  │        AUDITED              │   KPIs met?
       │                             │
       └─────────────────────────────┘
            ↑                         ↑
      WHO?                        HOW?
    Competent?                  Per procedure?
```

### Key Questions
- Are inputs conforming?
- Are process parameters controlled?
- Are operators competent and trained?
- Is equipment maintained and capable?
- Are work instructions followed?
- Are outputs conforming?
- Are KPIs being met?

## Product Audit (9.2.2.4)

### Purpose
Verify product conformance at appropriate stages of production and delivery.

### Scope
- Dimensional verification vs. drawing
- Functional testing vs. specification
- Appearance vs. standards
- Packaging and labeling
- Documentation/traceability

### Approach
- Select sample per Control Plan
- Measure against all drawing requirements
- Verify special characteristics
- Check packaging and identification
- Document all measurements

### Frequency
- At defined stages (per Control Plan)
- All special characteristics covered annually
- After process changes

---

## Layered Process Audit (LPA)

### Purpose
Standardized process verification at multiple organizational levels.

### Structure

| Level | Auditor | Frequency | Scope |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Level 1 | Team Leader | Daily | Key process steps |
| Level 2 | Supervisor | Weekly | Process area |
| Level 3 | Manager | Monthly | Department |
| Level 4 | Plant Manager | Monthly | Multiple areas |

### Key Characteristics
- Same checklist at all levels
- Focus on standardized work
- Quick (10-15 minutes)
- Immediate corrective action
- Trend tracking

---

## Audit Planning

### Annual Audit Schedule

Consider:
- All QMS processes over cycle (max 3 years)
- All manufacturing processes annually
- Risk-based frequency (high risk = more frequent)
- Previous audit results
- Customer complaints
- Internal quality performance
- Changes to processes

### Audit Plan Elements

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Audit number | Unique identifier |
| Date | Scheduled date |
| Scope | What will be audited |
| Criteria | Requirements to audit against |
| Auditor(s) | Qualified auditor assignment |
| Auditee | Process owner/department |
| Duration | Expected time |

## Finding Classification

### Major Nonconformance
**Definition:** Absence or complete breakdown of system to meet requirement, or situation likely to result in shipping nonconforming product.

**Examples:**
- No documented procedure when required
- Consistent failure to follow procedure
- Pattern of nonconforming product
- Missing required records

**Action:** Requires root cause analysis, corrective action, and verification before certification.

### Minor Nonconformance
**Definition:** Single lapse in meeting a requirement; does not affect product quality or system integrity.

**Examples:**
- Isolated instance of missing signature
- Minor record-keeping gap
- Single deviation from procedure
- Incomplete training record

**Action:** Requires correction, may require root cause and corrective action.

### Opportunity for Improvement (OFI)
**Definition:** Not a nonconformance, but improvement recommendation.

**Examples:**
- Better organization possible
- More efficient method available
- Good practice from other areas
- Proactive enhancement

**Action:** Optional implementation, tracked for consideration.

## Corrective Action Process

### Timeline Requirements

| Finding | Initial Response | Corrective Action | Verification |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Major | 24-48 hours | 30 days max | Within 90 days |
| Minor | 5 business days | 60 days max | Within 90 days |
| OFI | 30 days | As appropriate | As appropriate |

### Corrective Action Elements
1. **Containment**: Immediate action to contain impact
2. **Root Cause**: Analysis to determine true cause (5-Why, Fishbone)
3. **Corrective Action**: Action to eliminate root cause
4. **Implementation**: Execute corrective action
5. **Verification**: Confirm effectiveness
6. **Prevent Recurrence**: Systemic changes
