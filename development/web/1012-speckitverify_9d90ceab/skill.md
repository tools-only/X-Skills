## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

**Goal**: Perform comprehensive verification of the implemented feature against specifications, ensuring all requirements are met, tests pass, and code quality standards are satisfied. This command runs AFTER `/speckit.implement` completes.

**Critical Principle**: This is a READ-ONLY analysis command. The ONLY file that may be written is `verification-report.md` in the feature directory. No other modifications are permitted.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Setup & Prerequisites

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse JSON for:
- FEATURE_DIR (absolute path)
- AVAILABLE_DOCS list
- Repository root

For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

Abort if implementation appears incomplete with guidance to run `/speckit.implement` first.

### 2. Load Verification Context

**Load artifacts in order** (progressive, on-demand):

**Required**:
- tasks.md: Verify all tasks marked completed [X]
- spec.md: Requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria
- plan.md: Tech stack, architecture, file structure

**Optional** (load if present):
- data-model.md: Entity definitions and relationships
- contracts/: API specifications
- research.md: Technical decisions and constraints
- quickstart.md: Integration scenarios
- checklists/: Quality validation items

**Codebase**:
- Implementation files referenced in tasks.md
- Test files (unit, integration, e2e)
- Configuration files
- Documentation updates

### 3. Task Completion Verification

**Check tasks.md**:

For each task in tasks.md:
- [ ] Task is marked [X] or [x] (completed)
- [ ] No tasks remain with [ ] (incomplete)
- [ ] All file paths mentioned exist in codebase
- [ ] Implementation addresses task description

**Output**:
```
TASK COMPLETION STATUS
Total tasks: X
Completed: X [X%]
Incomplete: X [X%]
Status: [PASS/FAIL]
```

**If incomplete tasks found**:
```
INCOMPLETE TASKS:
- [Task ID]: [Description] → [Reason not completed]
```

Verification FAILS if any task incomplete unless justified (explicitly marked as deferred/optional in tasks.md).

### 4. Requirements Coverage Analysis

**Map implementation to specification**:

For each requirement in spec.md:

#### A. Functional Requirements
- [ ] Implementation code exists
- [ ] Code logic matches requirement description
- [ ] All acceptance criteria satisfied
- [ ] Edge cases handled

#### B. Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance targets met (if specified)
- [ ] Security measures implemented
- [ ] Accessibility requirements satisfied
- [ ] Scalability considerations addressed

#### C. User Stories
- [ ] All user actions supported
- [ ] Success criteria demonstrable
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully

**Output format**:
```
REQUIREMENT: [ID or description]
Status: [COVERED/PARTIAL/MISSING]
Implementation: [File paths]
Evidence: [Specific code references]
Acceptance Criteria Met: X/Y
Issues: [If any]
```

### 5. Architecture & Design Compliance

```

### 6. Data Model Validation

**If data-model.md exists**:

For each entity:
- [ ] Entity class/model exists
- [ ] All fields present with correct types
- [ ] Relationships implemented correctly
- [ ] Validations in place
- [ ] State transitions (if any) handled

**Check**:
- Foreign key constraints
- Cascade behaviors
- Index definitions

- Fields: [X/Y present, types correct]
- Relationships: [X/Y implemented]
- Validations: [List]
- Status: [PASS/FAIL]
```

### 7. Contract Compliance

**If contracts/ exists**:

For each contract file:

#### A. API Endpoints

- [ ] HTTP methods correct
- [ ] Request schema validation implemented
- [ ] Response schema matches contract
- [ ] Status codes per specification

#### B. Error Handling
- [ ] All error cases from contract covered
- [ ] Error response format matches contract
- [ ] Appropriate HTTP status codes used

#### C. Business Logic
- [ ] Implements contract behavior precisely
- [ ] Edge cases from contract handled

**Output**:
```
CONTRACT: [Filename]
Endpoint: [Method] [Path]
- Route: [MATCH/MISMATCH]
- Request Schema: [VALID/INVALID]
- Response Schema: [VALID/INVALID]
- Error Handling: [COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE]
- Logic Compliance: [PASS/FAIL]
Status: [PASS/FAIL]
```

### 8. Test Execution & Coverage

**Run test suites**:

#### A. Execute Tests
```bash
# Run all test commands from plan.md or infer from project type
npm test              # or pytest, cargo test, etc.
npm run test:coverage # or equivalent
```

#### B. Analyze Results
- [ ] All tests pass (100% success rate)
- [ ] No skipped tests (unless explicitly documented)
- [ ] No test warnings or errors
- [ ] Coverage meets threshold (from plan.md or ≥90% default)

#### C. Test Quality
- [ ] Tests cover positive scenarios
- [ ] Tests cover negative/error scenarios
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases and boundaries
- [ ] Tests validate business logic
- [ ] Integration tests verify component interactions
- [ ] E2E tests (if specified) validate user flows

**Output**:
```
TEST EXECUTION RESULTS
Total Tests: X
Passed: X [100%/less]
Failed: X
Skipped: X
Duration: Xs

COVERAGE METRICS
Lines: X%
Branches: X%
Functions: X%

Error: [Message]
File: [Path:Line]
Expected: [Value]
Actual: [Value]
```

## Verification Principles

### Strictness Levels

**CRITICAL** (Must Pass):
- All tasks completed
- All requirements covered
- All tests passing
- No security vulnerabilities
- No contract violations

**HIGH** (Should Pass):
- Code quality standards
- Documentation completeness
- Performance optimization
- Constitution compliance

**MEDIUM** (Nice to Pass):
- Code comments
- Optimization opportunities
- Style improvements

**LOW** (Optional):
- Minor refactoring suggestions
- Additional test scenarios

### Pass/Fail Criteria

**PASS** requires:
- 100% task completion (or justified deferrals)
- 100% requirements covered
- 100% test pass rate
- ≥90% test coverage (or plan.md threshold)
- 0 critical security issues

- Linting errors
- Contract violations
- Architecture violations

### Evidence Requirements

**Every finding must include**:
- Specific file path and line numbers
- Concrete evidence (code snippets, test output)
- Expected vs actual comparison
- Remediation guidance

**No speculation allowed**:
- Don't assume code exists if not found
- Don't guess at intent
- Don't hallucinate test results
- Quote actual output/errors

### Token Efficiency

**Progressive analysis**:
- Load files on-demand
- Analyze in phases
- Stop on critical failures (optional)
- Summarize verbose output

**Compact reporting**:
- Use tables for metrics
- Group similar issues
- Link to full details
- Prioritize actionable items
