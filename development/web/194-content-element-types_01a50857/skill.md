# Content Element Types for Textbook Chapters

This reference describes the various non-pure-text content elements that can be used to break up textbook content and enhance learning. Each element type should be specified in `<details markdown="1">` blocks when generating chapter content.
The content of the details blocks should be to describe what the learning objective is and
how a non-pure-text element can be used to promote learning.

## Driven By An Learning Objective

Behind the strategy for every diagram is to help the student learn. A unit of learning
is called a Learning Objective and diagrams are a wonderful way to teach visually.

By understanding the `Bloom Levels` and `Bloom Verbs` of learning objective we encounter, we can map the objective to a specific type of interactive diagram, chart, infographic or even a MicroSim.

Here are the six Bloom Levels of learning objectives

1. Remember (L1) - Recall facts and basic concepts
2. Understand (L2) - Explain ideas or concepts
3. Apply (L3) - Use knowledge to solve problems
4. Analyze (L4) - Examine relationships, connect concepts
5. Evaluate (L5) - Judge value, make decisions
6. Create (L6) - Design new solutions, produce original work

Here are the Bloom Verbs associated with each Bloom Level.When
you generate a diagram specification within a details block, use both the Bloom Level and Bloom Verb to describe a MicroSim.

### Remember (L1)
list, define, recall, identify, name, recognize, locate, describe

### Understand (L2)
explain, summarize, interpret, classify, compare, contrast, exemplify, infer

### Apply (L3)
use, execute, implement, solve, demonstrate, calculate, apply, practice

### Analyze (L4)
differentiate, organize, attribute, compare, contrast, examine, deconstruct, distinguish

### Evaluate (L5)
judge, critique, assess, justify, prioritize, recommend, validate, defend

### Create (L6)
design, construct, develop, formulate, compose, produce, invent, generate

5. Compare-Contrast Matrix — Fill in similarities and differences between 
items 

### Evaluate (L5) — Make judgments and assess quality 

1. Classification Sorter — Categorize examples as valid/invalid or by quality
2. Error Detector — Find and flag mistakes in code, proofs, or arguments
3. Ranking Ladder — Order items by effectiveness, quality, or priority
4. Decision Tree Navigator — Evaluate criteria to reach justified conclusions 
5. Rubric Rater — Score examples against defined criteria

## Element Types Overview

The goal is to have not have more than four paragraphs of pure text without incorporating one of these elements. Students don't like to see large blocks of pure text scrolling in their intelligent textbook. They want to interact with the content.

## 1. Markdown Lists

**Type identifier:** `markdown-list`

**When to use:**
- Enumerating key points, features, or characteristics
- Presenting step-by-step procedures
- Listing examples or categories

**Implementation:** Embed directly in markdown content (no `<details markdown="1">` block needed)

**Requirements:**
- ALWAYS place a blank line before the list
- Use numbered lists for sequences or ordered items
- Use bullet lists for unordered collections

**Example:**
```markdown
The following are key characteristics of graph databases:

- Native graph storage
- Constant-time traversals
- Flexible schema
```

## 2. Markdown Tables

**Type identifier:** `markdown-table`

**When to use:**
- Comparing features across multiple dimensions
- Presenting structured data
- Showing before/after comparisons

**Implementation:** Embed directly in markdown content (no `<details markdown="1">` block needed)

**Requirements:**
- ALWAYS place a blank line before the table
- Use clear, concise column headers
- Keep cell content brief
- Ensure proper markdown table syntax

**Example:**
```markdown
Here is a comparison of database types:

| Feature | RDBMS | Graph Database |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| Schema | Rigid | Flexible |
| Joins | Required | Native traversal |
| Query Speed (multi-hop) | Slow | Fast |
```

## 3. Admonitions

An admonition is another way to break up a wall of text.
They should be used only occasionally. Try to not have
more than one per page.

Our intelligent textbooks use the MkDocs Material theme
which supports admonitions.

Here are the admonition types supported by MkDocs Material:

```markdown
!!! note
 This is a note admonition.

!!! abstract
 This is an abstract/summary/tldr admonition.

!!! info
 This is an info/todo admonition.

!!! tip
 This is a tip/hint/important admonition.

!!! success
 This is a success/check/done admonition.

!!! question
 This is a question/help/faq admonition.

!!! warning
 This is a warning/caution/attention admonition.

!!! failure
 This is a failure/fail/missing admonition.

!!! danger
 This is a danger/error admonition.

!!! bug
 This is a bug admonition.

!!! example
 This is an example admonition.

!!! quote
 This is a quote/cite admonition.

With custom titles:

!!! note "Custom Title Here"
 Content with a custom title.

Collapsible (requires pymdownx.details):

??? note "Click to expand"
 This content is hidden by default.

???+ note "Expanded by default"
 This content is visible but can be collapsed.

Inline admonitions (Material theme):

!!! info inline
 Inline left admonition.

!!! info inline end
 Inline right admonition.
```

The Collapsible admonition that uses `???` is a fun way to challenge students
test their knowledge.It can be used at the end of a chapter to present
a question and then reveal an answer.

```markdown
??? note "What are the first six digits of Pi? - Click to expand"
 3.14159
```

## 4. Diagrams and Drawings

In this section, you will create a detailed specification for a diagram, drawing, chart, flowchart, workflow, infographic or interactive MicroSim.

**Type identifier:** `diagram`

**When to use:**
- Illustrating system architectures
- Showing relationships between components
- Explaining abstract concepts visually
- Depicting data flows or processes
- Defining an infographic that has items in a diagram or workflow with hover-triggered information boxes

**Implementation:** 

Add a level 4 header that indicates we are placing a diagram in the content and leave
a template for an iframe that displays the diagram or microsim

```markdown
#### Diagram: {{DIAGRAM_NAME}}
<iframe src="../../sims/{MICROSIM_NAME}/main.html" width="100%" height="500xp" scrolling="no"></iframe>
```

Note that the {MICROSIM_NAME} in the src path must be a string kebab-case (lowercase letters and dashes)

Use `<details markdown="1">` block with a detailed specification

**Required information in description:**

- Diagram Name - A title-case name of the diagram that is unique in the chapter
- Bloom Taxonomy - one of six levels of the 2001 Bloom Taxonomy: Remember, Understand, Analyze, Create

```

## 6. MicroSims (p5.js Simulations)

**Type identifier:** `microsim`

**When to use:**
- Demonstrating dynamic behavior
- Allowing students to experiment with parameters
- Visualizing algorithms or processes
- Showing cause-and-effect relationships

**Implementation:** Use `<details markdown="1">` block with specification

**Required information in description:**
- Learning objective (what concept is being taught)
- Visual elements in the simulation
- Interactive controls (sliders, buttons, inputs)
- Default parameter values
- What happens when parameters change
- Canvas layout (drawing area + controls area)
- Animation or static visualization

### CRITICAL: Instructional Pattern Selection

**Before specifying visual effects, determine the appropriate interaction pattern based on Bloom's level:**

| Bloom Level | Recommended Pattern | Avoid |
|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| Remember (L1) | Flashcards, matching, labeling | Complex animations |
| **Understand (L2)** | **Step-through with worked examples, concrete data visibility** | **Continuous animation** |
| Apply (L3) | Parameter exploration, calculators | Passive viewing |
| Analyze (L4) | Network explorers, pattern finders | Pre-computed results |
| Evaluate (L5) | Classification sorters, rubric raters | No feedback |
| Create (L6) | Model editors, builders | Rigid templates |

**For UNDERSTAND level objectives:** Do NOT specify animation or particle effects. Instead, specify:
- What DATA must be visible at each stage
- Step-through controls (Next/Previous buttons)
- Concrete worked examples with real values
- Prediction opportunities before revealing answers

### Data Visibility Requirements (REQUIRED for Understand/Explain objectives)

When the learning objective involves "explain," "describe," or "understand," you MUST specify what data transformations the learner needs to SEE:

```
Data Visibility Requirements:
  Stage 1: Show [raw input data]
  Stage 2: Show [first transformation with concrete values]
  Stage 3: Show [intermediate result]
  ...
  Final: Show [output with connection to input]
```

**Bad specification (visual-focused):**
```
Animation: Data flows between stages with particle effects
Visual style: Smooth transitions with glowing nodes
```

**Good specification (data-focused):**
```
Data Visibility Requirements:
  Stage 1: Show raw query "physics ball throwing"
  Stage 2: Show tokenized array ["physics", "ball", "throwing"]
  Stage 3: Show synonym expansion: throwing → [throw, projectile, launch]
  Stage 4: Show match scores with calculation breakdown
  Stage 5: Show ranked results with highlighted matching terms
Interaction: Step-through with Next/Previous buttons
```

### Instructional Rationale (REQUIRED)

Every MicroSim specification must include an Instructional Rationale explaining WHY the chosen interaction pattern supports the learning objective:

```
Instructional Rationale: Step-through with worked examples is appropriate
because the Understand/explain objective requires learners to trace the
process with concrete data. Continuous animation would prevent prediction
and obscure the actual data transformations.

**Example specification:**
```xml
<iframe src="../../sims/{MICROSIM_NAME}/main.html" width="100%" height="500xp" scrolling="no"></iframe>

## General Guidelines for All Content Elements

1. **Progressive Complexity:** Place simpler elements earlier in the chapter, more complex ones later
2. **Concept Coverage:** Ensure elements connect back to concepts listed in "Concepts Covered"
3. **Learning Objectives:** Every element should serve a clear pedagogical purpose
4. **Accessibility:** Provide text alternatives for visual elements
5. **Consistency:** Use similar visual styles and color schemes throughout a chapter
6. **Interactivity:** Favor interactive elements (infographics, MicroSims) that enable student engagement tracking
7. **Balance:** Mix different types of elements rather than using the same type repeatedly

## Details Block Template

For any element requiring specification (types 3-10), use this template:

```xml
<iframe src="../../sims/{MICROSIM_NAME}/main.html" width="100%" height="500xp" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Brief descriptive title</summary>
Type: [element-type]

Purpose: [What educational goal does this serve?]

[Element-specific details as outlined above]

Implementation: [Technology/approach to be used]
</details>
```

The specification should be detailed enough that another skill or developer can implement the element without additional context.
