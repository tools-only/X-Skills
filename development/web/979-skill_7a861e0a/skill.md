# Build Your Helm Skill

Before learning Helm—packaging Kubernetes deployments as reusable charts—you'll **own** a Helm skill.

---

## Step 1: Get the Skills Lab

1. Go to [github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab](https://github.com/panaversity/claude-code-skills-lab)
2. Click the green **Code** button
3. Select **Download ZIP**
4. Extract the ZIP file
5. Open the extracted folder in your terminal

```bash
cd claude-code-skills-lab
claude
```

---

## Step 2: Create Your Skill

Copy and paste this prompt:

```
Using your skill creator skill create a new skill for Helm charts. I will use
it to package Kubernetes applications from hello world to professional production
charts. Use context7 skill to study official documentation and then build it
so no self assumed knowledge.
```

Claude will:
1. Fetch official Helm documentation via Context7
2. Ask you clarifying questions (templating complexity, values structure, dependencies)
3. Create the complete skill with references and templates

Your skill appears at `.claude/skills/helm-chart/`.

---

## Done

You now own a Helm skill built from official documentation. The rest of this chapter teaches you what it knows—and how to make it better.
