## Overview

This bar chart displays how many concepts in a 200-concept learning graph have each number of prerequisites (0 through 8+). The visualization helps educators and instructional designers evaluate whether their learning graph has appropriate complexity distribution.

The chart highlights the **optimal range** (2-4 prerequisites) where most well-structured concepts should fall, and shows the **average** prerequisite count across all concepts.

## Features

### Interactive Elements

- **Hover tooltips** - Display exact concept count and percentage for each bar
- **Smooth animations** - Animated bars on page load
- **Color coding** - Green bars indicate optimal range (2-4), gold bars show other ranges
- **Annotations** - Visual indicators for optimal zone and average line

### Visual Design

- **Optimal Range Shading** - Light green background highlights the 2-4 prerequisite range
- **Average Line** - Blue dashed vertical line at 3.1 shows the mean
- **Metrics Panel** - Six key statistics displayed below the chart
- **Analysis Section** - Interpretation guidance for understanding the distribution

## Interpretation Guide

### Key Metrics

1. **Total Concepts (200)** - The complete size of the learning graph
2. **Total Dependencies (620)** - Sum of all prerequisite relationships
3. **Average Dependencies (3.1)** - Mean number of prerequisites per concept
4. **Median (2)** - Middle value when concepts are sorted by prerequisite count
5. **Mode (2)** - Most common number of prerequisites
6. **In Optimal Range (84%)** - Percentage of concepts with 1-5 prerequisites

### What Makes a Healthy Distribution

**Bell-Curve Shape**: The distribution should resemble a bell curve, with most concepts in the middle ranges (2-4 prerequisites) and fewer concepts at the extremes.

**Foundational Layer**: Having 5-10% of concepts with 0 prerequisites (foundational concepts) provides clear entry points.

**Optimal Range**: 70-90% of concepts should have 1-5 prerequisites, indicating appropriate granularity.

**Few Complex Concepts**: Less than 5% of concepts should have 6+ prerequisites to avoid overwhelming learners.

### Red Flags

- **Flat distribution**: Suggests inconsistent concept granularity
- **Too many foundational concepts** (>15%): May indicate concepts are too broad
- **Too many complex concepts** (>10% with 6+ prerequisites): Concepts may need to be broken down
- **Heavily skewed distribution**: Indicates structural issues in the learning graph

## Customization Guide

### Changing the Data

To modify the chart data for your own learning graph, edit the `data` array in `main.html`:

```javascript
const data = {
    labels: ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8+'],
    datasets: [{
        label: 'Number of Concepts',
        data: [12, 45, 58, 42, 25, 12, 4, 2, 0], // Replace with your counts
        // ... rest of configuration
    }]
};
```

### Updating Metrics

Update the calculated metrics in the HTML to match your data:

```html
<div class="metric-value">200</div>  <!-- Total concepts -->
<div class="metric-value">620</div>  <!-- Total dependencies -->
<div class="metric-value">3.1</div>  <!-- Average -->
<div class="metric-value">2</div>    <!-- Median -->
<div class="metric-value">2</div>    <!-- Mode -->
<div class="metric-value">84%</div>  <!-- Optimal range % -->
```

### Adjusting the Optimal Range

To change the optimal range shading (currently 2-4), modify the annotation configuration:

```javascript
optimalZone: {
    type: 'box',
    xMin: 1.5,  // Start at 2 (1.5 accounts for bar centering)
    xMax: 4.5,  // End at 4
    // ... styling
}
```

### Moving the Average Line

Update the average line position:

```javascript
averageLine: {
    type: 'line',
    xMin: 3.1,  // Your calculated average
    xMax: 3.1,
    label: {
        content: 'Average: 3.1',  // Update label text
        // ... styling
    }
}
```

### Customizing Colors

Modify the bar colors in the `backgroundColor` array:

```javascript
backgroundColor: [
    'rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.8)',  // Bar for 0 prerequisites
    'rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.8)',  // Bar for 1 prerequisite
    'rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.6)',  // Bar for 2 (optimal - green)
    'rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.6)',  // Bar for 3 (optimal - green)
    'rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.6)',  // Bar for 4 (optimal - green)
    'rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.8)',  // Bar for 5
    'rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.8)',  // Bar for 6
    'rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.8)',  // Bar for 7
    'rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.8)'   // Bar for 8+
],
```

## Calculating Your Own Metrics

To generate these metrics from your learning graph CSV:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load learning graph
df = pd.read_csv('learning-graph.csv')

# Count prerequisites per concept
prerequisite_counts = df['Dependencies'].str.split('|').str.len()
prerequisite_counts = prerequisite_counts.fillna(0)  # Foundational concepts

# Calculate metrics
total_concepts = len(df)
total_dependencies = prerequisite_counts.sum()
average_dependencies = total_dependencies / total_concepts
median_dependencies = prerequisite_counts.median()
mode_dependencies = prerequisite_counts.mode()[0]

# Count concepts in optimal range (1-5)
optimal_count = ((prerequisite_counts >= 1) & (prerequisite_counts <= 5)).sum()
optimal_percentage = (optimal_count / total_concepts) * 100

# Create distribution
distribution = prerequisite_counts.value_counts().sort_index()
```

- **Analyze** (Analyze) prerequisite distribution patterns in learning graphs to identify structural strengths and weaknesses
- **Evaluate** (Evaluate) whether a learning graph has appropriate complexity distribution using quantitative metrics
- **Interpret** (Understand) statistical measures (mean, median, mode) in the context of educational concept dependencies
- **Apply** (Apply) optimal range criteria (2-4 prerequisites) to assess concept granularity
- **Create** (Create) recommendations for improving learning graph structure based on distribution analysis

### Target Audience

- **Primary**: Instructional designers and curriculum developers working with learning graphs
- **Secondary**: Educators creating structured course content, educational technology specialists
- **Level**: Graduate-level education programs, professional development for curriculum designers
- **Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of learning graphs, familiarity with statistical measures (mean, median, mode)

### Activities

**Activity 1: Identifying Distribution Patterns (15 minutes)**

1. Examine the bar chart and identify which prerequisite count has the highest number of concepts
2. Calculate what percentage of concepts fall within the optimal range (2-4 prerequisites)
3. Compare the mean (3.1) with the median (2) - what does this tell you about the distribution shape?
4. Discuss: Why might having 12 foundational concepts (0 prerequisites) be appropriate for a 200-concept graph?

**Activity 2: Evaluating Quality Using Red Flags (20 minutes)**

Using the "Red Flags" criteria from the Interpretation Guide:

1. Assess whether this learning graph has too many foundational concepts (check if >15%)
2. Check if too many concepts have 6+ prerequisites (should be <10%)
3. Evaluate if the distribution resembles a bell curve or is heavily skewed
4. Write a 2-3 sentence quality assessment of this learning graph

**Activity 3: Comparative Analysis (25 minutes)**

1. Modify the data array in main.html to create a "problematic" learning graph with:
   - 40% foundational concepts (80 concepts with 0 prerequisites)
   - Flat distribution across other ranges
2. Compare the two visualizations side-by-side
3. Document 3 specific ways the problematic graph fails quality criteria
4. Propose how you would restructure the problematic graph to improve it

**Activity 4: Real-World Application (30 minutes)**

1. Use the provided Python code to analyze your own learning graph CSV file
2. Generate the prerequisite distribution data
3. Customize the chart with your data (update the data array and metrics)
4. Write an interpretation report addressing:
   - Is your distribution healthy? Why or why not?
   - What percentage falls in the optimal range?
   - What structural improvements would you recommend?

### Assessment

**Formative Assessment:**

- During Activity 1: Can students correctly identify the mode and calculate the optimal range percentage?
- During Activity 2: Do students accurately apply red flag criteria to evaluate graph quality?

**Summative Assessment:**

Students should demonstrate mastery by completing a practical analysis:

1. **Data Analysis** (30 points): Calculate mean, median, mode, and optimal range percentage from a provided dataset
2. **Visual Interpretation** (30 points): Identify structural issues in 3 different learning graph distributions
3. **Quality Evaluation** (20 points): Write a comprehensive quality assessment using all red flag criteria
4. **Recommendations** (20 points): Propose specific, actionable improvements for a problematic learning graph

**Success Criteria:**
- Students can independently evaluate a learning graph's prerequisite distribution
- Students can articulate why 70-90% of concepts should fall in the 1-5 prerequisite range
- Students can generate their own distribution charts from CSV data
- Students can distinguish between healthy bell-curve distributions and problematic patterns

### Extension Activities

- **Advanced**: Use the Chart.js Annotation Plugin to add custom quality threshold lines
- **Research**: Investigate how different subject domains (math vs. history vs. programming) might have different optimal distributions
- **Collaborative**: Compare learning graphs across a cohort and identify discipline-specific patterns
