[Cheat Sheet (PDF)](https://github.com/dmccreary/claude-skills/blob/main/slides/Workshop-Cheat-Sheet.pdf)

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code Account:** - All users **must** have the $20/month Claude Code Pro account.  We do not use ChatGPT.
Visitors are welcome to watch others. However, to leave the workshop with your own working textbook, Claude Code is required.
- **Background:** Users should know how to use a computer keyboard (including copy and paste), the computer mouse and have basic familiarity with tools like GitHub, markdown and command-line tools in the Terminal or Shell.
- **Course Description:** Please come with a detailed course description prepared and ask your AI to classify learning objectives using the 2001 Bloom Taxonomy.
- **GitHub Account:** Users should have created and tested a GitHub account before they arrive at class.
- **Claude Code Skills Installed:** Please make sure that Claude Code installed with all skills loaded and usage visible.  Test the installation like this:

   > \> Hi Claude!  What skills do you know about?

This should return a list of about 30 Skills

- **Claude Code Account Monitoring:** Users should know how to check and extend their own token usage: [https://claude.ai/settings/usage](https://claude.ai/settings/usage)


!!! Warning
    You **must** have administrative rights on your computer.  Computers managed by an institution must have their institution install a developer environment and test the Claude Code Skills before those computers can be used.
    It is critical that the gaols of the institution are aligned with the generation of free open-source textbooks
    before institutional resources are used in this course.

## Workshop Goal

By the end of this workshop, participants will understand the steps to create an intelligent textbook using
Claude Code Skills. 
Students will learn the steps in the creation of intelligent textbooks and the MicroSims within them.

## Workshop Outline

### Step 1: Introduction & Setup

#### 1.1 Welcome & Overview

- What are intelligent textbooks? (5 levels of intelligence)
- What is Claude Code?  How is it different that just using the web-based Claude or ChatGPT?
- Can I use Cursor or Windsurf
- Why use Claude Code Skills for textbook creation?
- Workshop structure and expected outcomes

#### 1.2 Environment Setup

Our book building tools depend on Claude Code Skills and the mkdocs build system.
The following shows how these tools also depend on other systems.

<iframe src="../../sims/install-book-env/main.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
[Fullscreen](../sims/install-book-env/main.html)

- Verify Claude Code installation
- List available skills with `/skills` command
- Review course description format
- Clone starter template or create new MkDocs project

**Hands-on:** Each participant runs `./scripts/bk-list-skills` and verifies their course description file exists.

---

### Step 2: Course Description

#### Course Description Quality
- Components of a quality course description
- Use Bloom's 2001 Taxonomy to list the learning objectives of the course
- Create precise definitions of terms you plan to use in the course

**Demo:** Use `/skill course-description-analyzer` on sample course description.  The goal is to
get your course description above 85 of 100 points before you go to the next step (learning graph generation)

**Hands-on:** Participants analyze their own course descriptions and refine based on feedback

### Step 3: Learning Graph Generation

- What is a learning graph? (concepts + dependencies)
- DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) constraints
- No circular links (bk-check-loops)
- Taxonomy categorization (12 categories)
- Quality metrics interpretation

**Demo:**
1. Generate learning graph with `/skill learning-graph-generator`
2. Review generated files in `docs/learning-graph/`:
   - `learning-graph.csv` (concept list with dependencies)
   - `quality-metrics.md` (validation report)
   - `learning-graph.json` (vis-network visualization data)

**Hands-on:** Each participant generates their learning graph and reviews quality metrics

### Step 4: View and Edit Your Learning Graph

`> run the install-learning-graph-viewer skill`

Note that you may need to redo the legend for color and ordering of the taxonomy.

---

### Step 5: Generate Book Structure

`> run the book-chapter-generator skill`

After this step there will be a docs/chapters directory with one directory for each chapter.
The index.md file has a overview of each chapter and a list of the concepts that must be covered in the chapter

**Discussion:** How were concepts distributed across chapters? Does the ordering make pedagogical sense?

!!! tip
   By looking at the shell output you can see tradeoffs of breaking different concepts into balanced chapters.
   You can also try `log this session to logs/book-chapter-generator.md`

### Step 6: Generate Content
- Concept-to-chapter mapping
- Respecting dependency order
- Balancing chapter length and complexity

`run the chapter-content-generator on chapter 1 @docs/chapters/01-*/index.md`

Repeat this for several chapters

**Review together:**
- Markdown structure and formatting
- Admonitions and callouts
- Breaking up the "Wall of Text" problem
- Insertion of non-pure-text items (lists, tables, MicroSims)

The remainder of this class is "Supplementary Materials"

### Step 7: Glossary Creation 
- ISO 11179 definition standards (precise, concise, distinct, non-circular)
- Automatic glossary generation from concept list and terms in chapters
- Suggest terms that might have been missed

**Demo:** Use `run the glossary-generator skill` to create `docs/glossary.md`

**Hands-on:** Participants generate glossaries and review 3-5 definitions for quality

**Demo:** Generate content for one chapter with `/skill chapter-content-generator`

**Hands-on:** Participants generate content for their first chapter

### Step 8: FAQ Generation

- The default generate about 70 FAQs but you can ask for fewer or more
- Use for helping chatbots get started
- Used to map multiple intents into standardized responses

#### Step 9: Quiz Generation (5 min)
- Bloom's Taxonomy-aligned questions
- Concept mapping to learning graph
- Interactive quiz format

**Demo:** Use `/skill quiz-generator` for a sample chapter

**Hands-on:** Participants generate quiz for their first chapter

---

### Step 10 Interactive Elements - MicroSims

#### Introduction to MicroSims 
- What are MicroSims? (interactive p5.js simulations)
- MicroSim directory structure (`docs/sims/[sim-name]/`)
- Designed for reuse and placement in any chapter or any website
- Use `iframe` to insert into a chapter
- Educational value of interactivity
- There are over 10 types of skills that know how to create MicroSims

#### p5.js MicroSim Creation
- Two-region pattern (drawing canvas + controls)
- Seeded randomness for reproducibility
- Iframe embedding in chapter content

**Demo:** Create a simple MicroSim with `/skill microsim-p5`
- Example: Visualizing slope and y-intercept changes in linear equations
- Show `main.html` structure
- Show `index.md` documentation with iframe

#### 4.3 Alternative Visualization Skills (10 min)
- **Chart.js** - data visualizations (bar, line, pie charts)
- **Mermaid** - flowcharts and process diagrams
- **Timeline** - chronological event sequences
- **Venn diagrams** - set relationships
- **Maps** - geographic visualizations

**Demo:** Quick examples of 2-3 different visualization types

**Discussion:** Which visualization types best suit different subject areas?

---

### Part 5: Quality Assurance & Deployment (10 minutes)

#### 5.1 Metrics & Validation (5 min)
- Book metrics generation (word counts, concept coverage)
- Chapter-level metrics
- Quality score interpretation

**Demo:** Use `/skill book-metrics-generator` to create comprehensive metrics report

#### 5.2 Site Building & Deployment (5 min)
- MkDocs build process
- Local preview with `mkdocs serve`
- GitHub Pages deployment with `mkdocs gh-deploy`

**Demo:** Build and preview site locally

**Hands-on:** Participants preview their textbook site at `http://localhost:8000`

---
