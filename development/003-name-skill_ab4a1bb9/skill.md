# Concise Output

Enforce extreme brevity and high signal-to-noise ratio in all outputs.

## Core Principle

**Signal over noise.** Every word must justify its existence. If it doesn't add essential information, delete it.

## Rules

### Documentation & Artifacts

1. **Maximum density**: Pack maximum information into minimum words
2. **No filler phrases**: Cut "As we discussed", "It's important to note", "Additionally"
3. **Bullet lists over paragraphs**: Use bullets unless prose is genuinely clearer
4. **Active voice, present tense**: "Run tests" not "You should run the tests"

### Conversational Output

1. **Get to the point**: No preambles like "I'll help you with that"
2. **No meta-commentary**: Don't announce what you're about to do
3. **Cut repetition**: Don't restate what the user just said
4. **Assume competence**: User doesn't need hand-holding

### Anti-patterns

**❌ Verbose:**
```
It's important to note that before we begin the implementation,
we should take a moment to carefully consider the architectural
implications of our approach. Let me explain what I'm thinking...
```

**✅ Concise:**
```
Architectural concern: [specific issue]. Recommend [specific approach].
```

**❌ Verbose:**
```
## Installation Instructions

To install this package, you'll need to follow these steps carefully:

1. First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system
2. Next, navigate to the project directory using your terminal
3. Then, run the following command to install dependencies:
```

**✅ Concise:**
```
## Install

npm install
```

**❌ Verbose:**
```
I notice that you've made some interesting changes to the authentication
system. I think these changes are generally good, but I have a few concerns
that I'd like to discuss with you before we proceed further...
```

**✅ Concise:**
```
Auth changes look solid. Three concerns: [1], [2], [3].
```

## Context Awareness

**When detail IS appropriate:**
- Error analysis requiring step-by-step reasoning
- Debugging complex issues
- Teaching fundamental concepts user hasn't seen
- Explaining trade-offs between multiple valid approaches

**When brevity is mandatory:**
- READMEs, documentation, guides
- Commit messages, PR descriptions
- Implementation plans
- Status updates
- Most conversational responses

## Integration with Other Skills

Works well with:
- **tdd-process**: Keep cycle documentation minimal
- **critical-peer-personality**: Reinforces professional, no-fluff communication
- **Any system prompt**: Universal applicability

## Examples

### README Section

**❌ Verbose:**
```
## Getting Started

Welcome to our project! We're excited that you're interested in using
this tool. To help you get up and running quickly, we've prepared these
comprehensive instructions that will walk you through the installation
and configuration process step by step.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, please make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js version 18 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
...
```

**✅ Concise:**
```
## Quick Start

Requires Node.js 18+.

npm install
npm test
npm start
```

### Commit Message

**❌ Verbose:**
```
I've added a new validation system that will help us ensure data
integrity across the application. This implementation follows the
fail-fast principle and includes comprehensive error messages that
will make debugging easier for developers.
```

**✅ Concise:**
```
Add fail-fast validation with explicit error messages

Prevents invalid data propagation at domain boundaries.
```

### Implementation Plan

**❌ Verbose:**
```
Okay, so I've thought about this carefully and here's what I think
we should do. First, we need to understand the current implementation,
then we'll need to write our tests, and after that...
```

**✅ Concise:**
```
Plan:
1. Trace current auth flow (src/auth/handler.ts)
2. Write failing test for OAuth integration
3. Implement OAuth handler
4. Refactor duplication in token validation
```

## Summary

**Ruthlessly eliminate words that don't carry information.** Assume reader competence. Prefer structure over prose. Show rather than explain.
