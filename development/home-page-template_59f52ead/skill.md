+----------------------------------------------------------+

Aspect Ratio: 1.91:1 (e.g., 1910x1000 pixels)
```

### Step 4: Generate the AI Image Prompt

Create a detailed prompt for the AI image generator. Follow this template:

```
A wide landscape book cover background (1.91:1 aspect ratio) for "[BOOK TITLE]".

[BACKGROUND DESCRIPTION]: Deep [PRIMARY COLOR]-to-[SECONDARY COLOR] gradient background.

[MONTAGE ELEMENTS]: A montage of [THEME] elements including:
- [Element 1 with visual description]
- [Element 2 with visual description]
- [Element 3 with visual description]
- [Continue for 6-10 elements]

[STYLE]: [VISUAL STYLE] design aesthetic with [ACCENT COLORS] accents.

[COMPOSITION]: Elements softly fade toward edges with subtle vignette, leaving center area darker/cleaner for white title text overlay.

[TECHNICAL]: Professional quality, high resolution. No text in image.
```

#### Example Prompts by Topic

**For Educational Technology Book:**
```
A wide landscape book cover background (1.91:1 aspect ratio) for an educational technology textbook. Deep blue (#1a237e) to teal (#00695c) gradient background with a montage of EdTech elements: glowing neural network patterns suggesting AI, network graph visualizations with interconnected nodes, timeline bars with milestone markers, small data charts and graphs, flowchart arrows, animated particle trails, a stylized 6-level pyramid in graduated colors (purple to blue), interactive UI elements like sliders and toggle buttons, lightbulb icons representing insight, interconnected gears showing process. Modern flat design aesthetic with warm orange (#ff7043) and electric purple (#7c4dff) accents. Elements softly fade toward edges, leaving center darker for white title text overlay. Professional, tech-forward, educational mood. No text in image.
```

**For Data Science Book:**
```
A wide landscape book cover background (1.91:1 aspect ratio) for a data science textbook. Dark navy (#0d1b2a) to deep purple (#1b0d2a) gradient background with a montage of data science elements: scatter plot visualizations, regression lines, decision tree branches, Python code snippets (stylized/blurred), Jupyter notebook cells, pandas dataframe grids, neural network layer diagrams, confusion matrix heatmaps, ROC curve shapes, bar and histogram silhouettes. Modern technical aesthetic with cyan (#00bcd4) and magenta (#e91e63) accent glows. Elements arranged as floating panels with subtle shadows, fading toward edges. Center area has darker overlay for white title text. Professional, analytical, modern mood. No text in image.
```

**For Business/Management Book:**
```
A wide landscape book cover background (1.91:1 aspect ratio) for a business management textbook. Deep charcoal (#263238) to dark blue (#1a237e) gradient background with a montage of business elements: organizational chart hierarchies, strategy matrix grids, upward trending arrows, pie chart segments, Gantt chart bars, handshake silhouettes, target/bullseye icons, ascending bar graphs, connected stakeholder nodes, briefcase icons, growth curve lines. Clean corporate aesthetic with gold (#ffc107) and teal (#009688) accents. Elements distributed evenly with professional spacing, subtle fade toward edges. Center reserved for white title text with semi-transparent overlay. Professional, strategic, authoritative mood. No text in image.
```

### Step 5: Generate the Cover Image

1. Copy the generated prompt
2. Use an AI image generator:
   - **ChatGPT/DALL-E**: Paste prompt directly
   - **Midjourney**: Add `--ar 191:100` for aspect ratio
   - **Stable Diffusion**: Use appropriate settings for 1910x1000
3. Generate 2-4 variations
4. Select the best result
5. Download at highest available resolution

### Step 6: Add Title Text Overlay (Optional)

If adding title text directly to the image:

1. Use image editing software (Canva, Figma, Photoshop, GIMP)
2. Add semi-transparent dark rectangle in center (opacity 40-60%)
3. Add title text in white
4. Recommended fonts: Inter, Montserrat, Source Sans Pro, or system sans-serif
5. Export as PNG at 1910x1000 pixels minimum

**Note:** Many users prefer to let the image stand alone without baked-in text, using HTML/CSS overlays instead for flexibility.

### Step 7: Save the Cover Image

Save the final image to the docs folder:

```
docs/img/cover.png
```

Recommended specifications:
- Format: PNG (for quality) or WebP (for size)
- Dimensions: 1910x1000 pixels minimum
- File size: Under 500KB for web performance

### Step 8: Create the Home Page (docs/index.md)

Create or update `docs/index.md` with proper frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: {{BOOK_TITLE}}
description: {{BOOK_DESCRIPTION}}
image: /img/cover.png
og:image: /img/cover.png
twitter:image: /img/cover.png
hide:
  - toc
---
<style>
.md-content__inner h1 {display: none !important;}
</style>

## Troubleshooting

### Image Not Appearing in Social Previews

1. Ensure image path starts with `/` (absolute from site root)
2. Verify image exists at `docs/img/cover.png`
3. Check image dimensions (minimum 1200x630 for best compatibility)
4. Clear social platform caches using their debug tools
5. Wait 24 hours for caches to refresh

### Image Quality Issues

- Use PNG for sharp graphics and text
- Minimum 1910x1000 pixels
- If file size is too large, use WebP or optimize PNG

### Frontmatter Not Working

- Ensure `---` delimiters are on their own lines
- No spaces before first `---`
- YAML syntax must be valid (proper indentation, colons)

## Quick Reference

```yaml
# Minimal frontmatter for social sharing
