## Description

<purpose>
An elixir for risky code changes. Refactors feel safe ("I'm just cleaning up")
but they're where bugs hide. This chains risk assessment → careful implementation
→ verification → documentation. The ceremony slows you down just enough to
catch problems before production does.
</purpose>

**Tags:** `development`
