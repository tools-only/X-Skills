## Overview

Agents are specialized AI assistants with dedicated context windows, custom prompts, and specific tool access. They enable efficient problem-solving by delegating task-specific work to focused experts.

### Key Benefits

- **Context Preservation**: Each agent operates independently, keeping main conversation focused
- **Specialized Expertise**: Fine-tuned with detailed instructions for specific domains
- **Reusability**: Available across projects and shareable with team
- **Flexible Permissions**: Each agent can have different tool restrictions
- **Autonomous Selection**: Claude automatically selects appropriate agent based on task

### Agent Locations

- **Project agents**: `.claude/agents/` (team-shared via git, highest priority)
- **User agents**: `~/.claude/agents/` (personal, available across projects)
- **Plugin agents**: Bundled with installed plugins

## Agent Usage Guidelines

### How to Use Agents

Agents can be invoked in multiple ways depending on your development environment:

#### In Claude Code

```
@agent-name [description or task]
```

Example:
```
@spring-boot-code-review-expert Review this controller for security issues
```

#### Using Task Tool (Programmatic)

```javascript
Task(
  description: "Review Spring Boot security",
  prompt: "Review the payment processing controller for authentication and authorization vulnerabilities",
  subagent_type: "developer-kit:spring-boot-code-review-expert"
)
```

#### In Commands

Commands automatically delegate to the appropriate agent based on the task:

```bash
/devkit.java.code-review full src/main/java
/devkit.java.security-review src/
/devkit.feature-development
```

### Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Agent**: Select agents that match your specific domain and task
2. **Provide Context**: Give detailed descriptions of what you want analyzed
3. **Be Specific**: More specific requests lead to better results
4. **Review Output**: Always review agent recommendations before applying
5. **Combine Agents**: Use multiple agents for comprehensive analysis (e.g., code-explorer → architect → code-reviewer)
6. **Leverage Specialization**: Use domain-specific agents (Spring Boot, React, Python) for better expertise

### Agent Selection Guide

| Task | Recommended Agent |
|------|---|
| Understand existing code | `code-explorer` |
| Design new architecture | `software-architect` |
| Review code quality | `code-reviewer` or domain-specific reviewer |
| Debug errors | `debugger` |
| Refactor code | Domain-specific `refactor-expert` |
| Security audit | Domain-specific `security-expert` |
| Create documentation | `documentation-specialist` or `document-generator-expert` |
| Mobile development | `expo-react-native-development-expert` |
| AI/LangChain4j | `langchain4j-ai-development-expert` |
| Prompt optimization | `prompt-engineering-expert` |

3. **Debug**: Use `debugger` if there are failures
4. **Refactor**: Use domain-specific `refactor-expert` to improve quality
5. **Architect**: Use `software-architect` for major redesigns

### Feature Development Workflow

1. **Architect**: Use `software-architect` to design the feature
2. **Implement**: Use domain-specific development expert
3. **Test**: Use domain-specific testing expert
4. **Review**: Use domain-specific code reviewer
5. **Document**: Use documentation specialist

### Brainstorming Workflow

The `/devkit.brainstorm` command orchestrates multiple specialist agents:

1. **Context Discovery**: Initial project understanding
2. **Idea Refinement**: Structured dialogue (one question at a time)
3. **Approach Exploration**: Present 2-3 alternatives with trade-offs
4. **Codebase Exploration**: `general-code-explorer` analyzes existing patterns
5. **Design Presentation**: Incremental validation of each section
6. **Documentation Generation**: `document-generator-expert` creates professional design document
7. **Document Review**: `general-code-reviewer` verifies quality and completeness
8. **Next Steps Recommendation**: Suggests appropriate development command
9. **Summary**: Documents all decisions and outputs

**Output**: Design document at `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD--design.md` with pre-filled next command

### Security Review Workflow

1. **Audit**: Use domain-specific `security-expert`
