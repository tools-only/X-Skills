## Key Concepts Credited

### Bulkification Patterns
The concept of bulkifying flows to handle 200+ records efficiently comes from community best practices established by multiple contributors including Amit Chaudhary, Beyond the Cloud, and official Salesforce guidance.

### Auto-Layout Best Practices
The recommendation to use locationX/Y = 0 for cleaner git diffs originated from DevOps-focused community discussions about Flow metadata management.

### Fault Path Requirements
The emphasis on fault paths for all DML operations comes from production reliability patterns shared across the Salesforce admin and developer communities.

### XML Element Ordering
The strict alphabetical ordering requirement for Flow XML elements was documented by community members experiencing deployment issues and validated against Salesforce metadata API requirements.
