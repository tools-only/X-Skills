# obsidian-master-skill

Unified skill for all Obsidian vault operations. Routes to workflows and context files.

## Workflow Routing

| Intent | Workflow | Tool |
|--------|----------|------|
| Create a note (any type) | `Workflows/CreateNote.md` | `Tools/NoteCreator.py` |
| Search vault (DQL, content, tags) | `Workflows/SearchVault.md` | `Tools/SearchVault.py` |
| Vault health, orphans, broken links | `Workflows/ManageVault.md` | `Tools/VaultManager.py` |
| Extract knowledge from conversation | `Workflows/CaptureKnowledge.md` | `Tools/NoteCreator.py` |
| Create/edit .base database views | `Workflows/CreateBase.md` | `Tools/BaseBuilder.py` |
| Daily note create/enhance | `Workflows/DailyNote.md` | `Tools/NoteCreator.py` |
| Process inbox notes into PARA | `Workflows/ProcessInbox.md` | `Tools/VaultManager.py` |
| Sync project docs to vault | `Workflows/SyncDocs.md` | `Tools/VaultManager.py` |

## Context Files

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `MarkdownReference.md` | Obsidian Flavored Markdown: wikilinks, embeds, callouts, properties, math, mermaid |
| `RestApiReference.md` | Local REST API endpoints, URI scheme, plugin API classes, Python client |
| `VaultOrganization.md` | PARA folders, frontmatter schemas, naming conventions, Dataview queries |
| `BasesReference.md` | .base YAML schema, filters, formulas, functions, view types |
| `IntegrationPatterns.md` | Claude Code integration patterns (Direct, Manifest, MCP, COG, Claudesidian) |
| `KnowledgeCapturePatterns.md` | ADR, concept, how-to, meeting note templates for knowledge extraction |

## Examples

```
"Create a new project note for API redesign"     -> Workflows/CreateNote.md
"Search my vault for notes about Kubernetes"      -> Workflows/SearchVault.md
"Find orphan notes and suggest connections"       -> Workflows/ManageVault.md
"Save what we just discussed as an ADR"           -> Workflows/CaptureKnowledge.md
"Create a base view of all active projects"       -> Workflows/CreateBase.md
"Create today's daily note"                       -> Workflows/DailyNote.md
"Process my inbox"                                -> Workflows/ProcessInbox.md
"What's the Obsidian markdown syntax for X?"      -> MarkdownReference.md (context only)
"How do I use the REST API?"                      -> RestApiReference.md (context only)
"How do bases formulas work?"                     -> BasesReference.md (context only)
```

## Tools (Python)

All tools use `click` CLI, `httpx` for REST API, `pyyaml` for frontmatter, `pathlib` for direct file access.
Dual mode: REST API when Obsidian running, direct file fallback otherwise.

| Tool | Commands |
|------|----------|
| `Tools/SearchVault.py` | `status`, `auth`, `search --type dataview\|content\|jsonlogic` |
| `Tools/VaultManager.py` | `health`, `orphans`, `broken-links`, `lifecycle`, `move`, `inbox` |
| `Tools/NoteCreator.py` | `create`, `daily`, `capture` |
| `Tools/BaseBuilder.py` | `create`, `validate`, `preview` |
