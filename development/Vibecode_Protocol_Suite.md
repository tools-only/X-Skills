Okay, so what I wanted to discuss today, or what I need your help with particularly, has to do with how the whole VibeCode workflow works. And I'm thinking of making a couple of new, what I call them, workflows that would be like heading workflows that make us get something similar to what Kilo does with their whole agentic platform. So let me explain. Let me give you an overview. In KiloCode, which is an OSS platform, you have an orchestrator mode, a debugging mode, an ask mode, a code mode, an accept mode, and a preview, and a review mode, you understand? And all this is sourced by YAML files, does that make sense? Yes, it does. Now, the beauty of this is that you can have an orchestrator mode that knows itself that, okay, it can call other modes and assign them detailed prompts and tasks for them to do. And then when they are done, they return back, they answer back, and then it's the way everything is orchestrated. And once they reply in their chat, that chat gets sent back to the orchestrator for the orchestrator to review and be like, okay, you said you did this, now let me check if you actually did it. So it's like this whole back and forth. Now that's really cool because when you couple that with our already existing like Genesis, build, design workflow that we have and other things that we have, it makes everything so powerful. Because one of the biggest issues that we have is having one model try to do everything at once in one chat. Even if it's just the Genesis, for example, but let's say the model is really good at following instructions, the model can be very, very much pressured to try and be so good at everything at once. Compared to like, let's say you run the Genesis, and okay, the model analyzes users' intents and like, okay, you make the PRD, it gets it back, or you make the PRD and the coding guidelines, then it gets it back and it's like, oh, you make the GitHub issues and whatnot. Do you understand? So what I'm thinking is... I am going to basically, because these open source, I can just get you the YML files from KiloCode, and we're going to kind of like merge them. We're going to like format them, yeah? And instead of spawning sub-agents, like getting to switch into different modes, we're just going to create a new folder structure, where, where I like, we'll create like a task folder. There's already a task folder by default, and I think the way I want the task folder was, um, what is done and what isn't done, so like done and undone. But I think we should have like, maybe sub-agents, do you understand, maybe there should be a sub-folder on that task for sub-agents. And instead of sub-agents folder, it's like, okay, the agent, the model goes through it and it's like, okay, I'm going to create all these tasks for all these sub-agents, do you understand? Then the user can go in and supervise these sub-agents. I can decide to either spawn it in a new chat, which I'll most likely definitely do, which is spawn a new chat. And then because of the way it spawns these sub-agents with the task format it uses, the sub-agent is expected to give it back feedback. Do you understand? And edit, maybe we could make it to edit the same, maybe it should edit a, it should create a new file with kind of like the same name as the sub-agents initial file, do you understand? And just maybe call it done or something. We can come up with something creative. And the long story short is that when it, when it gets that, I can now be like, I can now go back to the main chat and be like, oh, these are all the work that all the sub-agents have done. Validate them and let's move on. So that way it makes sure that there's like a consistency in concerns across all agents. Does that make sense? Yes, that should make sense. So that's really what I want us to work on and want us to implement.

so now this is the directory full of all the defualt kilo prompt that we can now change to workflows, I would have said skills but I think workflows are better?
what's your take sigh
so yeah 
@/Deep_Source_Prompts/Kilo\ mode\ prompt

I also need you to underrstnad that i am targeting @/.agent not @/VibeCode-Agents\ (e.g\ Kilo-code)  although later one with what we make we can now make a version that tells the model that it can call differnt modes and new chats and what not, but for now this is what we get lol...

and when I talk about .agent you can see ther are two folders workflows and skills you can read them to understand how things work but ultimately we are focusing on creating worklfows which are .md files basically soooo yeah and tbh maybe we should just start with an orchestrator and a code workflow cuz those are the main two that really make the difference and they are the main 2, but you can documet some sutff in the @/Deep_Source_Prompts so that future devs cna know how to continue with the other stuffs
