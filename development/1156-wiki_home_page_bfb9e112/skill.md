# Welcome to planning-with-files

> **Work like Manus** — the AI agent company Meta acquired for **$2 billion**.

This is a Claude Code skill that transforms your workflow to use persistent markdown files for planning, progress tracking, and knowledge storage.

## What This Project Does

Instead of relying on volatile context windows, planning-with-files teaches Claude to use **files as memory**:

- `task_plan.md` - Your roadmap (phases, progress, decisions)
- `findings.md` - Research and discoveries
- `progress.md` - Session logs and test results

When context fills up, you don't lose work. Everything important is on disk.

## Why It Exists

After 50+ tool calls, Claude forgets your original goals. This skill solves that by:
- Re-reading the plan before major decisions (hooks)
- Storing findings in files instead of context
- Logging errors to prevent repetition
- Verifying completion before stopping

## Inspired By

Manus AI pioneered this pattern and went from launch to $100M+ revenue in 8 months. Their secret? **Context engineering through persistent files.**

## Community ❤️

- Git checkpoint workflows
- Windows PowerShell support
- Community forks and derivatives

**None of this would exist without you.**
