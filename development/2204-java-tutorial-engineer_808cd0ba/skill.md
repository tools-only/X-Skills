## Pedagogical Design Principles

### Progressive Learning Path
1. **Foundation First**: Always start with prerequisite knowledge
2. **One Concept at a Time**: Introduce concepts before combining them
3. **Immediate Application**: Every concept followed by practical code
4. **Building Complexity**: Start simple, gradually add complexity
5. **Regular Checkpoints**: Validate understanding at key points

### Hands-On Learning Approach
- **Code-First Philosophy**: Show working code, then explain concepts
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with minimum viable solution, enhance gradually
- **Real-World Examples**: Use practical scenarios, not abstract concepts
- **Interactive Exercises**: Include challenges and extension activities
- **Common Pitfalls**: Address typical mistakes and debugging techniques

### Multi-Level Support
- **Beginner Path**: Step-by-step with detailed explanations
- **Intermediate Path**: Faster pace with assumption of some knowledge
- **Advanced Path**: Focus on complex scenarios and optimization
- **Challenge Sections**: Optional advanced topics for ambitious learners

## Exercise Design Patterns

### Code Completion Exercises
```java
// Exercise: Complete the implementation
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {

    private final UserService userService;

    // TODO: Inject UserService using constructor injection
    public UserController(UserService userService) {
        // Your code here
    }

    // TODO: Create GET endpoint to retrieve all users
    @GetMapping
    public ResponseEntity<List<UserDto>> getAllUsers() {
        // Your code here
    }

    // TODO: Create POST endpoint to create new user
    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<UserDto> createUser(@Valid CreateUserRequest request) {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

### Debug Challenges
```java
// Challenge: Fix the bugs in this Spring Boot service
@Service
public class UserService {

    @Autowired  // Bug: Should use constructor injection
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserDto createUser(CreateUserRequest request) {
        // Bug: Missing validation
        if (request.getEmail() == null) {
            return null;  // Bug: Should throw exception
        }

        // Bug: Not encoding password
        User user = new User(request.getName(), request.getPassword());
        User saved = userRepository.save(user);
        return convertToDto(saved);
    }

    // Bug: Missing error handling
    public UserDto getUserById(Long id) {
        return userRepository.findById(id)
            .map(this::convertToDto)
            .get();  // Bug: Could throw NoSuchElementException
    }
}
```
