## Tunacode

This project is tunacode, much like you! It's a TUI code agent that can be used to code and debug code or general agentic tasks.

src/tunacode/ui is the TUI interface that is used to interact with the user.
src/tunacode/core is the core agent that is used to code and debug code or general agentic tasks.
src/tunacode/tools is the tools that are used to code and debug code or general agentic tasks.

Tests are located in the `tests/` directory covering tool decorators, tool conformance, compaction, and tool retry logic.

This project uses a CLI ticket system for task management. Run `tk help` when you need to use it.

## Design Philosophy

The TUI design is heavily inspired by the classic **NeXTSTEP** user interface. This choice reflects a commitment to **"the next step of uniformity"**.

- **Uniformity:** The interface should provide a consistent and predictable experience across all interactions.
- **User Informed:** A core tenet is to keep the user constantly informed of the agent's state, actions, and reasoning. No "magic" should happen in the background without visual feedback.
- **Aesthetic:** The look should be professional, clean, and retro-modern, echoing the clarity and object-oriented nature of the NeXTSTEP environment.

**UI Design Rule:** Always call the neXTSTEP-ui skill for any UI changes.

**Skill Location:** `.claude/skills/neXTSTEP-ui/`

- `SKILL.md` - Design philosophy and guidelines
- `NeXTSTEP_User_Interface_Guidelines_Release_3_Nov93.pdf` - Original 198-page reference
- `read_pdf.py` - Chunked PDF reader (`uv run python read_pdf.py --help`)

**Debug Rule:** For session corruption, dangling tool calls, abort/cancel bugs, or state persistence issues, invoke the debug-tunacode skill.

**Debug Skill Location:** `~/.claude/skills/debug-tunacode/`

- `SKILL.md` - Debug workflow and common issues
- `references/commands.md` - Quick debug commands for logs and sessions

## Workflow Rules

- Never begin coding until the objective is **explicitly defined**. If unclear, ask questions or use best practices.
- Always use `.venv` and `uv` for package management.
- Small, focused diffs only. Commit frequently.

## Code Style & Typing

- Enforce `ruff check --fix .` before PRs.
- Use explicit typing. `cast(...)` and `assert ...` are OK.
- `# type: ignore` only with strong justification.
- **Mypy Status (2026-01-26):** 58 errors in 19 files. These will be resolved after Gate 2 (dependency direction) work completes. Use `git commit -n` to bypass pre-commit hooks if blocked. Do NOT introduce new type errors.
- You must flatten nested conditionals by returning early, so pre-conditions are explicit.
- If it is never executed, remove it. You MUST make sure what we remove has been committed before in case we need to rollback.
- Normalize symmetries: you must make identical things look identical and different things look different for faster pattern-spotting.
- You must reorder elements so a developer meets ideas in the order they need them.
- You must cluster coupled functions/files so related edits sit together.
- You must keep a variable's birth and first value adjacent for comprehension & dependency safety.
- Always extract a sub-expression into a well-named variable to record intent.
- Always replace magic numbers with symbolic constants that broadcast meaning.
- Never use magic literals; symbolic constants are preferred.
- ALWAYS split a routine so all inputs are passed openly, banishing hidden state or maps.

## Naming Conventions

Consistent naming improves readability and maintainability. These conventions are enforced by pre-commit hooks.

### Files and Modules

- **Files**: `snake_case.py`
- **Packages**: `snake_case` directory names
- **Special**: `__init__.py` is the only exception to snake_case

Examples:
```
✅ read_file.py, agent_config.py, message_handler.py
❌ ReadFile.py, agentConfig.py, messageHandler.py
```

### Functions and Methods

- **Public functions/methods**: `snake_case`
- **Private functions/methods**: `_snake_case` (single leading underscore)
- **Dunder methods**: `__method__` (double underscore both sides)
- **Parameters**: `snake_case`

Examples:
```python
✅ def read_file(filepath: str) -> str:
✅ def _format_line(line: str, max_width: int) -> str:
✅ def __init__(self) -> None:

❌ def ReadFile(filepath: str) -> str:
❌ def formatLine(line: str, max_width: int) -> str:
```

### Classes and Types

- **Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Type aliases**: `PascalCase`
- **Enums**: `PascalCase` for the enum class, `UPPER_CASE` for members
- **Private classes**: `_PascalCase` (single leading underscore)
- **Generic type variables**: Single uppercase letter OK (`T`, `P`, `R`)

Examples:
```python
✅ class AgentConfig:
✅ class MessageHandler:
✅ class _InternalState:
✅ ModelName = str
✅ FilePath = str | Path

❌ class agent_config:
❌ class messageHandler:
❌ class Agent_Config:
```

### Constants and Variables

- **Constants** (module-level, immutable values): `UPPER_CASE`
- **Module-level variables**: `snake_case`
- **Private module variables**: `_snake_case`
- **Local variables**: `snake_case`

Examples:
```python
✅ MAX_FILE_SIZE = 100 * 1024
✅ DEFAULT_ENCODING = "utf-8"
✅ SUPPORTED_TOOL_NAMES = ["read_file", "list_dir"]
✅ _internal_cache: dict[str, Any] = {}

❌ maxFileSize = 100 * 1024
❌ DefaultEncoding = "utf-8"
❌ ReadOnlyTools = ["read_file", "list_dir"]
```

### Pre-commit Hook

The naming convention checker runs automatically on `git commit`. To run manually:

```bash
uv run python scripts/check-naming-conventions.py src/tunacode/**/*.py
```

Violations will block commits. Fix them before committing:

```
❌ Naming convention violations found:

  src/tunacode/core/config.py:42: 'maxRetries' should be snake_case, not camelCase
  src/tunacode/tools/helper.py:15: 'ProcessData' should be snake_case, not PascalCase
```

## Error Handling

- Fail fast, fail loud. No silent fallbacks. This is one of the most important rules to follow.
- Minimize branching: every `if`/`try` must be justified.

## Dependencies

- Avoid new core dependencies. Tiny deps OK if widely reused.
- Run tests with: `uv run pytest`.

## Scope & Maintenance

- Backward compatibility only if low maintenance cost.
- Delete dead code (never guard it).
- Always run `ruff .`.
- Use `git commit -n` if pre-commit hooks block rollback.

## Card Format

Bugs, docs, and module cards all use this unified structure.

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: <Short human-readable title>
link: <stable-slug-for-links>
type: <delta | doc | module>
path: <relative path, for modules/docs>
depth: <nesting level, 0 = root>
seams: <[A] architecture | [E] entry | [M] module | [S] state | [D] data>
ontological_relations:
  - relates_to: [[<primary-system-or-area>]]
  - affects: [[<component-or-module>]]
  - fixes: [[<bug-or-failure-mode>]] # for deltas
tags:
  - <area>
  - <symptom>
  - <tool-or-feature>
created_at: <ISO-8601 timestamp>
updated_at: <ISO-8601 timestamp>
uuid: <generated-uuid>
---
```

### Body Sections

- **Summary** - One paragraph, what and why, readable in a year
- **Context** - Optional, where it lives, how it surfaced
- **Root Cause** - For bugs: mechanism, not blame
- **Changes** - Bullet list of concrete changes
- **Behavioral Impact** - What users notice, what didn't change
- **Related Cards** - `[[links]]` to other cards

### Bug Rules

- Fix it, we don't care who caused it
- Document: what? where? when? why?
- No shims, fix at root
- Document how we missed it and how to prevent it

---

## Quality Gates

These are another layer to prevent slop, not pre-commit hooks.

### Gate 0: No Shims

Never use shims. It is a mortal sin to allow shims.

Instead, fix the interface. In some cases, it may be better to create a new interface for examples:

- If 19 files use an interface and our new work has a problem with it, the interface is not the problem
- If only two files use the interface and it's giving us issues, write it correctly
- The interface must be written in proper idiomatic way
- 99% of the time we don't need a unique interface; if a unique situation calls for one, it must be strongly justified with anchor comments

### Gate 1: Coupling and Cohesion (Constantine)

**High cohesion** = everything in a module serves one purpose
**Low coupling** = modules don't need to know each other's internals

Before writing or modifying code, answer:

- **What single responsibility does this module have?** If you can't state it in one sentence, the module is doing too much. Split until each piece has one job.
- **Can I change this module without changing others?** If no, you have a coupling problem.
- **Dependencies should flow one direction:** ui → core → tools → utils/types. Never reach backward (core importing from ui).
- **How many dots?** `state_manager.session.tool_handler._policy.rules[0].name = "allow"` coupling points. Each `.` is a place where changes can break you. More than 2 dots = smell; refactor to hide the chain.
- **What does this module hide?** "Every module hides a design decision that could change." If a module exposes its internals, it will churn when those internals change. UI hides Textual, core hides agent orchestration, tools hide system access.

**Example:** If a file gets touched more than 5 times in a month, it has a cohesion problem. Stop adding to it. Split it.

**Wrong:**

```
src/tunacode/ui/main.py  →  Textual UI + agent orchestration + tool execution + persistence
```

**Right:**

```
src/tunacode/ui/main.py              →  Textual UI concerns only
src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py     →  agent orchestration only
src/tunacode/tools/*.py              →  tool execution only
src/tunacode/core/state.py           →  persistence and session state only
```

### Gate 2: Dependency Direction (Martin)

Dependencies flow inward, never backward.

```
ui → core → tools → utils/types
  ↓
infrastructure (filesystem, shell, network)
```

**Dependency Map:** `docs/architecture/dependencies/DEPENDENCY_LAYERS.md`

The current dependency graph is frozen as a baseline. **DO NOT add new cross-layer violations.**

Note: The current layering is not ideal. We're prioritizing delivery and cleanup in parallel, so this baseline is the starting point. Do not regress from here as we map and converge on the ideal layering.

- If you fix one violation but create another, that's not progress
- UI should only push into CORE, not scatter imports everywhere
- Regenerate the dependency layers report with: `uv run python scripts/grimp_layers_report.py`

**Utils-level modules** (can be imported by any layer):
- `utils/` - helper functions
- `types/` - type definitions
- `configuration/` - static config data
- `constants.py` - module constants

**Rules:**

- Inner layers know nothing about outer layers
  - core/ never imports from ui/
  - tools/ never imports from ui/
  - utils/, types/, configuration/ import only from each other
- Infrastructure is a plugin
  - Filesystem, shell, network = details
  - Core logic doesn't know or care which system provider
- Depend on abstractions, not concretions
  - Pass interfaces, not implementations
  - Makes testing trivial, swapping backends trivial

**Example:** If core needs UI state, you're violating the boundary. Extract what you need and pass it as a plain argument.

**Wrong:**

```python
from tunacode.ui.app import TunaCodeApp

def run_agent(app: TunaCodeApp):
    app.notify_status("Running")  # core knows about UI layer
```

**Right:**

```python
from collections.abc import Callable

def run_agent(notify_status: Callable[[str], None]):
    notify_status("Running")  # core only knows about a callable
```

### Gate 3: Design by Contract (Meyer)

Every function is a contract with three parts:

- **Preconditions** - what must be true before calling
- **Postconditions** - what will be true after
- **Invariants** - what's always true

**Rules:**

- Caller guarantees preconditions - don't check inside what should be guaranteed outside
- Function guarantees postconditions - if it returns, the promise is kept
- Fail immediately if contract violated - no limping along with bad state

**Example:** If a tool expects a valid directory, don't silently return an empty result. That's a contract violation - raise.

**Wrong:**

```python
def list_dir(directory: str) -> str | None:
    if not Path(directory).exists():
        return None  # silent failure, caller doesn't know why
    return _render_dir(Path(directory))
```

**Right:**

```python
def list_dir(directory: str) -> str:
    """Precondition: directory exists and is a directory."""
    path = Path(directory)
    if not path.exists():
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Directory not found: {path}")
    if not path.is_dir():
        raise NotADirectoryError(f"Not a directory: {path}")
    return _render_dir(path)
```

### Gate 4: Documentation is Code (Knuth)

Docs and code are one system. If they diverge, the docs are lying.

**Rules:**

- **Code changes = doc changes**
  - If you change a module's behavior, update its codebase-map doc in the same PR
  - If you add a tool, update docs/codebase-map/modules/tools-overview.md
  - If you add a UI component, update docs/codebase-map/modules/ui-overview.md
- **Docs describe the system that exists, not the system you wish existed**
  - No aspirational docs ("we plan to...")
  - No stale docs ("this used to...")
  - Only current truth
- **The /docs/codebase-map folder mirrors src/tunacode**
  - Structure matches structure
  - When code moves, docs move
  - When code dies, docs die

**Example:** If you delete src/tunacode/tools/grep.py, you must also remove its entry from docs/codebase-map/modules/tools-overview.md in the same commit.

**Wrong:**

```
PR #263: "chore: remove unused grep tool"
  - deletes src/tunacode/tools/grep.py
  - leaves docs/codebase-map/modules/tools-overview.md still referencing it
```

**Right:**

```
PR #263: "chore: remove unused grep tool"
  - deletes src/tunacode/tools/grep.py
  - updates docs/codebase-map/modules/tools-overview.md to remove grep section
  - single atomic commit, code and docs together
```

## Memory Bank Directory

Maintain a `.claude` directory with:

- Do not use `.claude/markdown`; the seven folders below are the source of truth.

- **metadata/** — dependency graphs, file classifications, error pattern database
- **code_index/** — function call graphs, type relationships, interface mappings
- **debug_history/** — error-solution pairs indexed by component/error type
- **patterns/** — canonical implementation examples for this codebase
- **cheatsheets/** — quick-reference guides per component with gotchas
- **qa/** — solved problems database with reasoning
- **delta/** — semantic changelogs explaining changes

### Continuous Learning

Dump bugs, smells, issues here as you encounter them. Raw is fine. A skill will organize this into proper kb entries later.

Format: `[date] [type] description`

Types: bug, smell, pattern, lesson, antipattern

We are currently in the middle of a large rewrite few test exist and documentation and that is okay. We will build the test and documentation as we go
