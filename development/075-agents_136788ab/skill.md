# AGENTS.md - cascadeflow Development Guidelines

> ⚠️ **BRANDING: Always use lowercase "cascadeflow"** — not CascadeFlow or CASCADEFLOW.

## Mandatory Development Workflow

**EVERY feature or bug fix MUST follow this flow:**

```
PLAN → PLAN REVIEW → BUILD → TEST → REVIEW → COMMIT
```

### 1. PLAN
- Create plan document or structured response
- Identify: scope, approach, files to modify
- List 6-10 action items
- Include test strategy
- **Do NOT start coding until plan is reviewed**

### 2. PLAN REVIEW
- Present plan to user
- Wait for explicit approval ("go", "approved", "lgtm")
- Revise if user has feedback
- **Do NOT proceed without approval**

### 3. BUILD
- Implement per approved plan
- **Commit early and often** — every logical unit of work
- **Push frequently** — visible progress on GitHub
- Small, focused changes
- Follow coding standards below
- Stay within scope

**Commit frequency rule:**
- After each file change that works → commit
- After each function/feature complete → commit + push
- Never have >30 mins of uncommitted work
- Use descriptive commit messages for traceability

### 4. TEST
- Run: `pytest` (Python) / `npm test` (TypeScript)
- Add tests for new functionality
- **All tests MUST pass**

### 5. REVIEW
- Self-review all changes
- Present diff summary
- Check: types, errors, docs, breaking changes

### 6. COMMIT
- Only after user approval
- Format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
- **Never push to main**
- Create PR for Sascha to review

```

## Coding Standards

### Python
- Type hints required
- Docstrings for public APIs
- Black formatting
- Ruff linting

### TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled
- JSDoc for exports
- ESLint + Prettier

## Git Rules

1. **Never push to main** - Sascha releases
2. **Never merge PRs** - Sascha approves
3. **Never release** - Reserved for Sascha
4. Branch naming: `feat/[name]` or `fix/[name]`
5. PR titles: `feat: Add X` or `fix: Resolve Y`
6. **Commit often** - Traceable, visible progress
7. **Push often** - GitHub should always reflect current state
8. **Max 30 mins uncommitted work** - If it works, commit it
9. **NO Co-authored-by** - Never add Co-authored-by trailers
10. **NO AI attribution** - No "created by Codex/Claude/AI" in commits
11. **Author = saschabuehrle** - All commits appear as Sascha's work only

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `cascadeflow/quality/alignment_scorer.py` | Query-response alignment (KEEP IN SYNC with TS) |
| `packages/core/src/alignment.ts` | TS alignment scorer (currently v10, Python is v13+) |
| `cascadeflow/quality/confidence.py` | Confidence estimation |
| `cascadeflow/agent.py` | Main agent orchestrator |

## Current Priority

- **TS alignment scorer needs v11-v14 updates** from Python
- **Proxy feature** needs integration from `feature/routing-proxy-mvp`

## Evaluation Mode Exception

For **automated evaluation and testing tasks**, agents MAY bypass the PLAN REVIEW step when:
1. Task is explicitly labeled as "eval", "test", or "benchmark"
2. No code modifications are being made
3. Only running existing test scripts or making API calls

This allows agents to run comprehensive evaluations without blocking on approval.
