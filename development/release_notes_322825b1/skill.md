## Release Notes - Version 0.4.0

This release marks a significant milestone in expanding Next Gen UI's visualisation and integration capabilities and maturing evaluation framework. The highlight is the **developer preview** of Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol support, enabling seamless integration into multi-agent architecture. We've also added comprehensive chart visualization support with five chart types (bar, line, pie, donut, and mirrored-bar), enabling AI-driven data visualization with intelligent chart usage. We've also enhanced our evaluation framework with LLM-as-a-Judge functionality and multi-provider support, and significantly improved customization flexibility. This release continues our commitment to enterprise production readiness with Python 3.14 support, comprehensive configuration options, and streamlined component handling.
