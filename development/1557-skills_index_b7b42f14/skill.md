## Gaps and Future Work

### Concepts Not Yet Extracted

The following valuable concepts exist in the source repositories but were not extracted:

1. **APACHE-II Score**: Older scoring system, still used in some contexts
2. **Charlson Comorbidity Index**: Important confounder adjustment
3. **Ventilation Duration**: Time on mechanical ventilation
4. **Antibiotic Classification**: Categorization by class/spectrum
5. **MELD Score**: Model for End-Stage Liver Disease
6. **CRRT Concepts**: Continuous renal replacement therapy details
7. **Code Status**: DNR/DNI documentation

### eICU-Specific Concepts Needed

- APACHE IV (pre-computed in eICU)
- eICU pivoted lab values
- eICU vasopressor concepts
- Hospital-level clustering

### Additional Data Quality Skills

- Unit conversion guidelines
- Outlier detection thresholds
- Timestamp and time zone handling

## Usage Notes

1. **Dataset-Agnostic Design**: Skills document concepts, not dataset-specific implementations. Dataset-specific SQL lives in each skill's `scripts/` subdirectory.

2. **Pre-computed Tables**: Most clinical skills reference pre-computed derived tables in `mimiciv_derived` schema. These are available on BigQuery and can be regenerated locally via `m4 init-derived`.

3. **Script Files**: Full SQL implementations are in each skill's `scripts/` subdirectory, with separate files per dataset where applicable.

4. **Format Reference**: See [SKILL_FORMAT.md](SKILL_FORMAT.md) for the canonical skill structure specification.
