**Tom's request is DONE.** We've added **2,400+ lines** of comprehensive rate limit documentation across 6 plugins, plus a standardized template for all future plugins.

### 🌟 Community Champion: @TomLucidor

**Tom asked for transparency. We delivered.**

His December feedback transformed this marketplace:
1. *"Which plugins require paid APIs vs free/self-hosted?"* → **v4.1.0** (Make All Plugins Free initiative)
2. *"Note rate limits and registration requirements. Ideally agents with skills would learn how to be resourceful with a single IP."* → **v4.3.0** (THIS RELEASE)

**Epic claude-code-plugins-1k2: COMPLETED** - All 12 tasks finished. Tom notified on [Discussion #148](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/discussions/148).

### 📚 Documentation Added (2,400+ Lines)

- Annual savings: $228-22,788 vs Zapier/Make

#### **4. ai-sdk-agents** (187 lines) - Multi-Agent LLM Coordination
- Cost multiplication: 5 agents × $0.03/request = $0.15/workflow
- Provider rate limits divided across agents:
  - OpenAI: 500 RPM → 100 RPM per agent
  - Anthropic: 1,000 RPM → 200 RPM per agent
  - Google Gemini Free: 15 RPM → 3 RPM per agent (very restrictive!)
  - Ollama: ∞ Unlimited (hardware-limited only)
- Rate limit coordinator code examples

#### **5. Standardized Template** (406 lines) - For All Future Plugins

### 🙏 Thank You, Tom

**You kept us honest.** Before your feedback:
- We said "free" without explaining signup requirements
- We didn't document rate limits or IP tracking
- We had no multi-agent coordination guidance

**Now every major service type has:**
- ✅ Exact rate limits (verified from official docs)
- ✅ Registration requirements clearly stated
- ✅ Multi-agent coordination code examples
- ✅ Cost comparisons (paid vs free)
- ✅ Hybrid approaches (best of both worlds)

**The marketplace is better because of you.**

## [4.2.0] - 2025-12-23

### 🎉 Highlights
**Rate Limits & Transparency Initiative** - Thanks to community feedback from **@TomLucidor**, we're documenting the REAL constraints of "free" services. Because "free" should mean informed, not surprised.

### 🌟 Community Contributor Spotlight: @TomLucidor

**Tom is exactly the kind of user who makes open source better.**

- **173 issues/discussions** filed across **148 repositories** on GitHub
- Zero code commits - but his feedback drives real improvements
- On December 12, he opened [Discussion #148](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins-plus-skills/discussions/148) asking a simple question: *"Which plugins require paid APIs vs free/self-hosted?"*
- That question sparked the entire "Make All Plugins Free" initiative (v4.1.0)
- His follow-up: *"If there are rate limits and registration requirements like Alpha Vantage, please note them. Ideally agents with skills would learn how to be resourceful with a single IP."*
- This feedback is now driving **Epic claude-code-plugins-1k2**: comprehensive rate limit documentation across 12 plugins

**Tom's Pattern:** He doesn't write code, but he keeps projects honest. He asks the questions users are afraid to ask. He catches the gap between marketing ("free!") and reality ("25 requests/day").

**Thank you, Tom.** Your feedback made this marketplace significantly better. We're lucky to have contributors like you who keep it real.

### 📚 Documentation (Tom's Request)

### 🤖 Asset Generation System (NEW)

**Major Innovation**: Automated context-aware asset file generation using Vertex AI Gemini.

**Script**: `scripts/generate-missing-assets.py`
- **AI Model**: Gemini 1.5 Flash (gemini-1.5-flash-002) for stable, high-quota generation
- **Context-Aware**: Reads each plugin's README.md and plugin.json for accurate content generation
- **Multi-Format Support**: JSON, YAML, Markdown, HTML, Python, Shell scripts
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-second delay between API calls with exponential backoff (5s → 15s → 45s)
- **Progress Tracking**: SQLite database (`backups/asset_generation.db`) tracks all generation attempts
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts per file with intelligent backoff on quota errors
- **Safety**: Validates generated content before writing to disk

**Performance**:
- Generated 261+ assets successfully (as of Nov 15)
- Target: ~1,500 total assets across 231 plugins
- Zero failures with rate limiting enabled
- Average file size: 2,500 bytes (context-rich, production-ready)

**Example Output** (web-to-github-issue plugin):
```
assets/
├── issue_template.md (2,662 bytes) - GitHub issue format with web research context
├── config_template.json (2,514 bytes) - API settings, rate limiting, security configs
└── example_search_results.json (2,520 bytes) - Web search result format
```

**Commits**: e72aed1, bd57367

### 📋 Asset Audit Infrastructure (NEW)

**Comprehensive Plugin Audit System** identifying incomplete asset directories across the entire marketplace.

**Audit Report**: `asset-audit-report-20251115.txt`
- **Scope**: 252 plugins analyzed
- **Findings**: 231 plugins (92%) with incomplete asset directories
- **Impact Analysis**: `ASSET_AUDIT_RESPONSE.md` with root cause and recommendations

**Key Statistics**:
- 76 plugins missing SKILL.md files
- 230 plugins with incomplete asset directories
- Most common missing files:
  - `report_template.html` (19 plugins)
  - `example_dataset.csv` (8 plugins)
  - `config_template.json` (5 plugins)
  - `api_template.yaml` (4 plugins)

**Root Cause**: Automated plugin generation created `assets/README.md` with checklists but never generated the actual files.

**Resolution Strategy**:
- **Short-term**: Gemini-powered automated generation (in progress)
- **Medium-term**: Template library for common asset types
- **Long-term**: Enhanced plugin validation in CI/CD

**Commit**: 547f2b6

### 🔧 CI/CD Improvements

**GitHub Workflow Validation Enhancement** - commit 60ed152

**Problem**: Workflow only validated `plugins/community/*` and `plugins/examples/*`, missing 200+ plugins in other categories.

**Solution**: Dynamic plugin discovery using `find` command
```yaml
# Before: Hardcoded paths
for plugin in plugins/community/*/ plugins/examples/*/; do

# After: Dynamic discovery
find plugins/ -name "plugin.json" -path "*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json" | while read plugin_json; do
  plugin=$(dirname $(dirname "$plugin_json"))
```

**Impact**: Now validates all 253 plugins regardless of directory structure.

**Security Checks Added**:
- Hardcoded secrets detection
- AWS keys detection (blocks CI)
- Private key detection (blocks CI)
- Dangerous command patterns (`rm -rf /`)
- Command injection risks (`eval()`)
- Suspicious URLs (non-HTTPS, URL shorteners)
- MCP plugin dependency audit (`npm audit`)

**devops-automation-pack Plugin Fix** - commit 4ff8059

**Problem**: Invalid manifest with non-existent path references
```json
"commands": "./plugins/*/commands",  // Invalid wildcard paths
"agents": "./plugins/*/agents"
```

**Solution**: Removed invalid fields, kept only valid component declarations

**Impact**: Plugin now passes marketplace validation

### 📚 README Coverage Achievement

**100% README Coverage** - All 253 plugins now have comprehensive documentation.

**Jeremy-Firebase README Created** - commit 57f3523
- **Size**: 297 lines of comprehensive documentation
- **Content**:
  - Detailed feature overview
  - Vertex AI Gemini integration examples
  - Security rules patterns
  - Production deployment guide
  - A2A protocol usage
  - MCP tools reference
  - Code examples for all major features

**Cleanup**: Removed duplicate empty `fairdb-operations-kit/` directory (real plugin exists in `plugins/devops/`)

**Impact**: Asset generation can now proceed for all plugins (README provides essential context)

### 🔄 Marketplace Catalog Updates

### 👥 Contributors

Built by @jeremylongshore with Claude Code and Vertex AI Gemini 2.0 Flash

Special thanks to the community for 100+ ⭐ GitHub stars!

### 🚀 What's New

**Enhanced Agent Skills System:**
- **159 high-quality SKILL.md files** generated via improved batch processing
- **231 plugins enhanced** (98% of 236-plugin marketplace)
- **100% success rate** with zero failures across overnight batch
- **$0 processing cost** (Vertex AI free tier)
- **99.4% YAML validation pass rate**

### 🧠 Understanding Agent Skills

**What Are Agent Skills?**

Agent Skills are automatic capabilities that Claude activates based on your conversation context - no slash commands needed!

**File Structure:**
```
your-plugin/
└── skills/
    └── skill-adapter/
        └── SKILL.md       # Agent skill definition
```

**How It Works:**
1. Install plugin: `/plugin install postgres-backup-pro@claude-code-plugins-plus`
2. Mention need: "I need to backup my production database"
3. Claude automatically activates the relevant skill and guides you through the workflow
4. Get expert help with multi-phase workflows, code examples, and best practices

**Key Difference: Skills vs Commands**
- Commands: Manual activation with `/command-name`
- Skills: Automatic activation when Claude detects relevant context
- Result: More natural, conversational development workflow

See README for full educational guide with examples.

**Production Infrastructure:**
- Smart rate limiting (45-60s per plugin with 71.6% API quota remaining)
- SQLite audit trail with complete compliance tracking
- Automatic backup system with Turso disaster recovery
- Idempotent operations enabling fault-tolerant restarts
- Real-time observability with unbuffered logging

**Comprehensive Documentation Added:**
- Implementation guide (architecture, rate limiting, quality control)
- Batch processing metrics with data-driven analysis (26 KB report)
- Skills generation architecture and system design
- Proof of work with public evidence and GitHub references
- Post-release roadmap (10-week plan to 95%+ coverage)

### 📊 Key Metrics

- **Total Plugins:** 236
- **Plugins with Agent Skills:** 159 (67.4% coverage)
- **Plugins Enhanced:** 231 (98% of marketplace)
- **Success Rate:** 100% (0 failures)
- **Processing Time:** 13 hours 21 minutes (overnight batch)
- **API Quota Used:** 28.4% of Vertex AI free tier
- **Total Cost:** $0.00
- **Quality Score:** 99.4% YAML validation pass

### 🎯 Technical Achievements

**Optimization Journey:**
- Started: 90-120s delays (ultra-conservative testing)
- Data-driven optimization: Cut to 45-60s based on 12 hours of metrics
- Result: 2x faster processing while maintaining 3x safety margin
- Completion: 1:30 AM instead of 5:30 AM (4 hours saved)

**Quality Comparison:**
- **Our Agent Skills:** Average 3,210 bytes, up to 8,488 bytes (overnight-dev)
- **Anthropic's Examples:** ~500 bytes (template-skill)

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Fixed overnight-dev YAML frontmatter** - Removed markdown code fence before frontmatter delimiter
- **Validated all SKILL.md files** - 99.4% pass rate (164/165 plugins)

### 💡 System Design Highlights

**Rate Limiting Strategy:**
```python
# Base delay with randomness (prevents API patterns)
delay = 45.0 + random.uniform(0, 15.0)  # 45-60s

# Extra rest every 10 plugins (long-term sustainability)
if idx % 10 == 0:
    extra_delay = random.uniform(30, 60)
```

**Two-Phase AI Processing:**
1. Analysis phase (15-20s) - Understand plugin capabilities
2. Generation phase (30-40s) - Create comprehensive SKILL.md

**Quality Control:**
- Minimum file size: 8,000 bytes target
- YAML frontmatter validation
- Automatic backup before modification
- SQLite audit trail for compliance
- Idempotent operations (safe to re-run)

### 🎁 What's Next

**Post-Release Roadmap (10 weeks to 95% coverage):**
- Weeks 1-2: High-priority 8 plugins → 71% coverage
- Weeks 3-4: API Development Wave 1 (10 plugins) → 75%
- Weeks 5-6: API Development Wave 2 (15 plugins) → 82%

## [1.0.41] - 2025-10-16

### 🎉 Highlights

**✨ Introducing Skill Enhancers - The Missing Link Between Skills and Actions**

This release introduces **Skill Enhancers**, a new category of plugins that extend Claude's built-in Skills with automation. Anthropic gave Claude the ability to search, read, and analyze - we're giving you the ability to automate what happens next.

**The Pattern:**
```
Claude's Skill (Input) → Your Plugin (Action) → Real Result
```

**Example:**
```bash
claude: "research PostgreSQL indexing and create a ticket"

# Claude uses web_search Skill → finds 5 sources
# web-to-github-issue plugin → creates formatted issue
# ✅ GitHub issue #247 created with findings
```

**First Skill Enhancer:** web-to-github-issue - Automatically creates GitHub issues from web research

## [1.0.38] - 2025-10-15

### 🎯 Release Highlights

**🚀 Marketplace Reliability Hotfix**

Issue [#13](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins/issues/13) showed that our CLI marketplace import failed when extra metadata lived in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. This release restores a frictionless `/plugin marketplace add` experience while keeping the website’s richer data intact.

**What's New:**
- CLI marketplace catalog is now regenerated from an extended source file, stripping unsupported keys (`featured`, `mcpTools`, `pluginCount`, `pricing`, `components`).
- New `npm run sync-marketplace` command (backed by `scripts/sync-marketplace.cjs`) gives maintainers a one-step workflow to refresh the CLI-safe catalog.
- CI guard runs the sync script on every PR, failing fast if someone forgets to regenerate the CLI catalog.

**Migration Note:** Marketplace installs prior to 2025-10-15 still work, but run `/plugin marketplace remove claude-code-plugins` followed by `/plugin marketplace add jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins` to pick up the new `claude-code-plugins-plus` slug and avoid conflicts with Anthropic’s catalog.

---

### 🛒 Marketplace Catalog

- Introduced `.claude-plugin/marketplace.extended.json` as the single source of truth containing all metadata used by the Astro marketplace site.
- Regenerated `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to be fully schema-compliant with Claude Code CLI, resolving the import failure reported in #13.
- Updated marketplace generators (`marketplace/generate-content.js`, `marketplace/generate-missing-plugins.cjs`) to prefer the extended catalog so featured status, pricing, and component counts stay visible on the website without breaking the CLI.

---

### 🛠️ Tooling & CI

- Added executable `scripts/sync-marketplace.cjs` plus a package script entry so contributors can refresh the CLI catalog with a single command.
- Wired the sync step into `.github/workflows/validate-plugins.yml`; the workflow now blocks merges when `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is out of sync with the extended catalog.

---

### 📚 Documentation

- Updated README, CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, SETUP.md, and the plugin creation learning path to walk through the new “edit extended catalog → run sync” process.
- Highlighted the sync command in the common development tasks so marketplace updates stay CLI-safe before submission.

## [1.0.37] - 2025-10-13

### 🎯 Release Highlights

### 🔒 Security Infrastructure

#### New Security Policy (SECURITY.md)

**Comprehensive 500+ line security documentation:**

- **Threat Model** - 6 major attack vectors identified and mitigated
- **Plugin Verification Process** - Automated + manual + community review
- **Plugin Trust Levels** - Community → Verified → Featured (3-tier system)
- **Security SLAs** - Response time commitments (24hrs for critical issues)
- **Responsible Disclosure** - Clear vulnerability reporting process

**Threats Addressed:**
1. Prompt Injection Attacks (malicious instructions hijacking Claude)
2. Data Exfiltration (plugins sending user data to external servers)
3. Destructive Operations (rm -rf, data deletion)
4. Dependency Poisoning (malicious npm packages in MCP plugins)
5. Supply Chain Attacks (compromised maintainer accounts)
6. Typosquatting (similar plugin names tricking users)

#### Enhanced GitHub Actions Security Scanning

**4 new automated security steps** in `.github/workflows/validate-plugins.yml`:

**Scan 1 - Hardcoded Secrets Detection:**
- API keys, passwords, tokens (20+ character patterns)
- AWS keys (AKIA pattern detection)
- Private keys (BEGIN PRIVATE KEY)
- **Action**: Fails build if secrets found

**Scan 2 - Dangerous Pattern Detection:**
- Destructive commands (`rm -rf /`)
- Command injection (`eval()`)
- Data exfiltration (curl to IP addresses)
- Obfuscation (base64 decoding)
- **Action**: Fails on critical, warns on suspicious

**Scan 3 - Suspicious URL Detection:**
- Non-HTTPS URLs (except localhost)
- URL shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl) - phishing risk
- **Action**: Warns for manual review

**Scan 4 - MCP Dependency Scanning:**
- npm audit for all MCP plugins
- Production dependency vulnerability checks
- **Action**: Reports audit results

**Runs on**: Every PR + every push to main

#### Enhanced Pull Request Template

**15+ security checks** added to `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`:

**Automated Checks (8)**:
- No hardcoded secrets, AWS keys, private keys
- No destructive commands, eval(), command injection
- No base64 obfuscation, suspicious URLs
- HTTPS enforcement (except localhost)

**Manual Review (7)**:
- Prompt injection protection
- Data privacy/exfiltration prevention
- Permission audit (minimal necessary)
- Clear intent documentation
- Input validation
- Error handling (no sensitive data exposure)
- Dependency review (MCP plugins)

#### README Security Positioning

- **Security badge** in header badges row
- **Essential Documentation table** with User Security Guide as #1 item
- **Clean, minimalist structure** following release system philosophy
- Security visible but not cluttering above-the-fold

---

### Changed

- **Repository Model**: Pivoted from commercial plugin packs to open-source community marketplace
- **Monetization Strategy**: GitHub Sponsors + consulting/training instead of direct plugin sales
- **Distribution Model**: GitHub-based marketplace catalog (JSON) instead of Gumroad
- **Focus**: Community-driven growth and first-mover advantage

### Removed

- Commercial plugin packs infrastructure (`website/products/`)
- Gumroad sales integration (`website/marketing-site/`)
- Build automation for commercial distribution (`website/scripts/`)
- Internal business reports (`website/000-docs/`)

### Infrastructure

- Marketplace catalog: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with 4 plugins
- Plugin validation CI/CD pipeline
- GitHub Sponsors monetization framework
- Community contribution workflow

### Metrics

- **Production Plugins**: 1 (git-commit-smart)
- **Example Plugins**: 3 (educational)
- **Templates**: 4 (starter templates)
- **Validation Scripts**: 3 (quality assurance)
- **Documentation Pages**: 6+ (comprehensive guides)

### Migration Notes

This release represents a complete pivot from a commercial model to an open-source community marketplace. The restructure was motivated by:

1. **Distribution Reality**: Claude Code plugin marketplace doesn't support commercial sales
2. **Community Value**: Open-source model better serves developer community
3. **First-Mover Advantage**: Launched days after Anthropic's plugin announcement (October 2025)
4. **Sustainable Model**: GitHub Sponsors + consulting provides sustainable revenue

All quality work (validation systems, templates, production plugin) was preserved and migrated to the new structure.
