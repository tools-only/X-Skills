## Music & Cognitive State (Confidence: 0.94)

Music listening patterns reliably indicate cognitive and emotional states:

- Deep-dive listener: 74-track sessions, album-focused, not playlists
- Classical appreciation is real (Bach, Beethoven) - not just atmosphere

**AI Relevance:**
- High heavy-to-ambient ratio = elevated stress period
- King Gizzard presence is baseline, not diagnostic
- Heavy music peaked 2022 (job transition year) — mirrors emotional load
