Add a new feature to the @skills/book-installer called "help" - when the user asks "what does the            
  book-installer skill do" it should return a list of all the cool things that the book-installer can do       
  to add new features to the mkdocs book.  Start with things like "Adding support for equations", "Adding      
  support for social previews" "Adding support for social preview image overrides", "Adding support for        
  quizzes", "Add support for custom prompt admonitions with copy" etc.  The list should allow the user to      
  start with a minimal mkdocs.yml file but the skill should have rules for enriching the mkdocs.yml file       
  to add the new features.  Also add a line for "Add support for code highlighting" and "Add support for       
  simple feedback" and "Add support for detailed comment feedback" and "Add support for image zoom on          
  click"
