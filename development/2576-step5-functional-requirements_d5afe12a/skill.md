## Required Inputs

Before running this prompt, ensure you have completed artifacts from previous steps:

- [ ] **Customer Needs (CNs)** — from Step 3 (CN Generation prompt)
- [ ] **Software Vision** — from Step 4 (Software Vision prompt)

**⚠ Warning**: Do not proceed without these inputs. FRs cannot be generated independently—they must trace to Customer Needs and respect Software Vision boundaries.

---

## 📁 Output: Individual Requirement Files

**CRITICAL:** Each FR and NFR MUST be saved as an individual file so engineers can work on them as independent development units.

## Prompt

```
You are generating Functional Requirements (FR) and Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) for a Problem-Based Software Requirements Specification.

## Definition

**Functional Requirements (FR):** Define WHAT the software system SHALL DO to fulfill Customer Needs. FRs describe specific capabilities, behaviors, and functions—not how they are implemented.

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):** Define quality attributes and constraints on HOW WELL the system performs. NFRs specify performance, security, usability, reliability, and other quality characteristics.

## Required Inputs
I will provide:
1. Customer Needs (CNs) — outcomes the software must provide
2. Software Vision — scope, positioning, and boundaries

## Your Task
For each CN:
1. Generate FR statements that specify the system capabilities required
2. Identify any NFRs needed (quality attributes)
3. **Save each FR as an individual file** in functional-requirements/
4. **Save each NFR as an individual file** in non-functional-requirements/
5. Create index files (_index.md) for both folders

## FR Structured Notation

Each FR MUST follow this grammar:

The [Subject] shall [Verb] [Object] [Constraint] [Condition]

Where:
- **Subject**: The software system (e.g., "The CRM system", "The Invoice System")
- **Verb**: "shall" (mandatory) or "should" (desirable)
- **Object**: The specific action or capability
- **Constraint**: Limitations or quality attributes (optional)
- **Condition**: When/where this applies (optional)

## NFR Structured Notation

Each NFR MUST follow this grammar:

The [Subject] shall [Quality Attribute] [Measurable Target] [Condition]

Where:
- **Subject**: The software system
- **Quality Attribute**: Performance, security, usability, etc.
- **Measurable Target**: Specific, quantifiable criteria
- **Condition**: When/where this applies (optional)

## Traceability Rule (CRITICAL)
- Every FR MUST trace to at least one Customer Need (FR.X → CN.Y)
- Every NFR should trace to CNs or indicate which FRs it applies to
- One CN typically requires MULTIPLE FRs
- Every CN must be addressed by at least one FR

## Quality Rules (per ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148)
- **Complete**: All customer needs must be met by requirements
- **Correct**: All requirements must meet some customer need
- **Testable**: Each FR must have verifiable acceptance criteria
- **Unambiguous**: Use precise language, avoid vague terms
- **Measurable**: NFRs must have quantifiable targets

## Content Restrictions (CRITICAL)

**NO CODE SNIPPETS:** FR and NFR files MUST NOT contain:
- Programming code examples
- Code blocks with implementation logic
- Pseudo-code implementations
- SQL queries, API calls, or technical syntax

**NO CONSTRUCTION DETAILS:** FR and NFR files MUST NOT include:
- Database schemas or table definitions
- API endpoint specifications
- Class diagrams or implementation architecture
- Technology stack decisions
- Configuration details

**WHERE TO PUT CONSTRUCTION DETAILS:**
Construction and implementation details belong in separate design documents:
```
[srs-folder]/
├── functional-requirements/     # FR files (WHAT - no code)
├── non-functional-requirements/ # NFR files (WHAT - no code)
└── design/                      # Construction details (HOW)
    ├── architecture.md          # System architecture
    ├── data-model.md            # Database schemas
    ├── api-specification.md     # API endpoints
    └── implementation-notes/    # Technical notes per FR
```

This separation ensures:
1. Requirements stay technology-agnostic
2. Engineers can change implementation without changing requirements
3. Requirements documents remain readable by non-technical stakeholders
4. Traceability is maintained between requirements and design

## Output Format

For each FR, create a file FR-NNN-name.md with:
- Full requirement statement
- Traceability (CN → CP)
- 3+ Acceptance Criteria (testable)
- Priority and Status

For each NFR, create a file NFR-NNN-name.md with:
- Full requirement statement
- Category (Performance/Security/etc.)
- Measurement criteria
- Traceability
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Every FR uses syntax: The [Subject] shall [Verb] [Object] [Constraint] [Condition]
- [ ] Every FR saved as individual file (FR-NNN-name.md)
- [ ] Every FR traces to at least one CN
- [ ] Every CN from input is addressed by at least one FR
- [ ] All FRs are testable with clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] All FRs stay within Software Vision boundaries
- [ ] Index file (_index.md) created with all FRs listed
- [ ] NFRs have measurable targets (not vague terms)
- [ ] No implementation/design details in requirements (WHAT not HOW)
- [ ] No code snippets or programming examples in FR/NFR files
- [ ] Construction details deferred to separate design files

## Common Pitfalls

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Correct |
|----------|-----------|
| "The system shall use a MySQL database" | "The system shall persist client data between sessions" |
| "The system shall be user-friendly" | "The system shall allow users to complete registration in under 3 minutes" |
| FR with no CN link | Always specify FR → CN traceability in file |
| "The system shall be fast" | "The system shall return search results within 2 seconds" |
| All FRs in one file | Each FR in separate file for independent development |
| Vague NFR: "good performance" | Measurable NFR: "< 2 second response time" |
| Code snippet in FR file | Reference design docs for implementation details |
| Database schema in NFR | Keep schemas in design/data-model.md |
