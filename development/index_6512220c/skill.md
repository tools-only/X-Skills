# Architecture Overview

The **MCP Gateway** (ContextForge) is a production-grade gateway, proxy, and registry for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and A2A Agents. It acts as a unified entry point for tools, resources, prompts, and servers, federating local and remote nodes into a coherent MCP-compliant interface.

## High-Level Architecture Summary

**MCP Gateway (ContextForge)** is a comprehensive production-grade gateway built on modern Python technologies with a performance-first approach. For a detailed visual diagram of the high-performance components (Rust-powered libraries, async patterns, caching layers, and Kubernetes scaling), see the [Performance Architecture Diagram](performance-architecture.md).

### Performance-Optimized Foundation

ContextForge leverages cutting-edge Rust-powered components for maximum throughput and minimal latency:

- **orjson (Rust-Powered JSON Serialization)**: High-performance JSON parsing and serialization using Rust internals, delivering 5-6x faster serialization and 1.5-2x faster deserialization compared to Python's standard library, with 7% smaller output size. Enables sub-millisecond JSON-RPC responses even for large payloads.
- **Pydantic V2 (Rust-Core Validation)**: Runtime validation and data serialization powered by Pydantic 2.11+ with its Rust-based pydantic-core engine, providing 5-50x performance improvements over Pydantic V1 for schema validation, type coercion, and model serialization.
- **PyO3 Rust Plugins**: Extensible plugin framework supporting Rust modules via PyO3, enabling native-speed Python extensions for performance-critical operations. Rust plugins provide near-native performance for compute-intensive tasks while integrating seamlessly with the Python ecosystem.

This performance-first architecture enables ContextForge to handle high-throughput workloads while maintaining low latency for tool invocations, resource access, and federation operations.

### CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

This architecture supports both small single-instance deployments (SQLite + memory cache) and large-scale multi-cluster deployments (PostgreSQL + Redis + federation), making it suitable for development, staging, and production environments.

## Deployment Flexibility: Why Not Envoy/Istio?

ContextForge is architected for **maximum deployment flexibility**, from standalone Python modules to multi-regional container orchestration. This design philosophy fundamentally differs from service mesh architectures like Envoy/Istio.

### Modular Standalone Execution

The ContextForge ecosystem consists of **independently deployable modules** that can run standalone or be composed together:

**Core Gateway:**

- `mcp-contextforge-gateway-core` - FastAPI gateway with 33 services, 11 routers (~150K lines)
- `mcp-contextforge-gateway-ui` - HTMX + Alpine.js admin interface

**Independent Utilities (Zero Gateway Dependencies):**

- `mcp-contextforge-translate` - Protocol bridge: stdio ↔ SSE ↔ HTTP ↔ gRPC
- `mcp-contextforge-wrapper` - MCP client wrapper
- `mcp-contextforge-reverse-proxy` - NAT/firewall traversal proxy

**Plugin Ecosystem:**

- `mcp-contextforge-plugins-python` - 40+ Python plugins
- `mcp-contextforge-plugins-rust` - High-performance PyO3 plugins

**MCP Servers (Zero Gateway Dependencies):**

Sample servers:

- `mcp-contextforge-mcp-servers-python` - 4 Python servers
- `mcp-contextforge-mcp-servers-go` - 5 Go servers (static binaries, 5-15 MB)
- `mcp-contextforge-mcp-servers-rust` - Rust servers (static binaries, 3-10 MB)

**Agent Runtimes:**

Sample runtimes:

- `mcp-contextforge-agent-runtimes` - LangChain + future runtimes

**Infrastructure:**

- `mcp-contextforge-helm` - Kubernetes Helm charts (OCI registry)
- `mcp-contextforge-deployment-scripts` - Terraform, Ansible, Docker Compose

### Deployment Spectrum

**Standalone Execution:**

- Single Python module: `python -m mcpgateway`
- CLI tools: `mcptranslate`, `mcpwrapper`, `mcpreverseproxy`
- No external dependencies (SQLite + memory cache)
- Can be imported and embedded in other Python applications

**Serverless-Native:**

- **IBM Cloud Code Engine** (native deployment automation via Makefile)
- **AWS Lambda** (event-driven functions)
- **Google Cloud Run** (containerized serverless)
- **Azure Container Apps**

**Container Orchestration:**

- **Kubernetes** (vanilla, HPA, StatefulSets)
- **Red Hat OpenShift** (enterprise K8s)
- **Docker Compose** (local multi-container)
- **Podman** (rootless containers)
- Multi-arch container images (amd64, arm64, s390x, ppc64le)

**Multi-Regional Deployments:**

- Federation across geographic regions
- Redis Cluster for distributed caching
- PostgreSQL HA with replication
- Multi-cluster service mesh (optional)

### Why This Matters: Envoy/Istio Comparison

**Envoy/Istio Service Mesh Requires:**

- Container infrastructure (no standalone mode)
- Kubernetes control plane (overhead for simple deployments)
- Service mesh complexity (sidecar injection, mTLS configuration)
- External proxy layer (additional network hop, increased latency)
- Minimum resource overhead (sidecar per pod)

**ContextForge Provides:**

- **Built-in proxy/gateway capabilities** - No external proxy needed
- **Application-level MCP routing** - Protocol-aware, not just HTTP
- **Embedded observability** - OpenTelemetry, Prometheus built-in
- **Native compression and caching** - No sidecar required (Brotli/Zstd/GZip)
- **Zero-infrastructure dev mode** - SQLite + memory cache
- **Modular composition** - 14 independently deployable modules
- **Multi-format packaging** - PyPI packages, container images with multi-arch support, Helm charts, and binaries

### When to Use What

**Use Envoy/Istio When:**

- You need advanced service mesh features across ALL services (mutual TLS, canary deployments, complex traffic routing)
- You have existing service mesh infrastructure
- You're running polyglot microservices requiring unified traffic management
- Compliance requires external traffic control

**Use ContextForge Standalone When:**

- Lightweight MCP gateway without infrastructure overhead
- Development, testing, serverless deployments
- Edge deployments with minimal resources
- Embedded use cases (Python application integration)
- Single-node or small-scale deployments

**Use Both Together When:**

- Running in enterprise Kubernetes with service mesh requirements
- ContextForge modules handle MCP protocol concerns
- Envoy/Istio handle infrastructure concerns (mTLS, observability, traffic routing)
- Example: ContextForge gateway behind Istio ingress with mTLS between services

### Modular Composition with Envoy

Each ContextForge module can integrate with Envoy independently:

```yaml
# Example: ContextForge Translate + Envoy
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mcp-translate
spec:
  selector:
    app: mcp-translate
---
# Envoy handles external mTLS, rate limiting, load balancing
# ContextForge Translate handles MCP protocol bridging
```

The key architectural decision is **application-level intelligence** (MCP-aware routing, tool invocation, resource management) embedded in ContextForge modules, not delegated to infrastructure proxies. This enables:

1. **Protocol intelligence**: MCP-specific routing, federation, tool registry
2. **Deployment flexibility**: From `python -m mcpgateway` to multi-regional K8s
3. **Packaging options**: PyPI, containers, binaries, Helm charts
4. **Optional composition**: Works standalone OR with Envoy/Istio when needed

This architecture supports both small single-instance deployments (SQLite + memory cache) and large-scale multi-cluster deployments (PostgreSQL + Redis + federation), making it suitable for development, staging, and production environments.
