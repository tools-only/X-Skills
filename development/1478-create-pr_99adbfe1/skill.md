# Create Pull Request

Create a pull request with a well-structured description based on the branch changes.

## Instructions

### 1. Gather Context

First, collect information about the changes:

```bash
# Get current branch and verify it's not main
git branch --show-current

# Get commit history for this branch
git log --oneline main..HEAD

# Get detailed commit messages for context
git log --format="### %s%n%n%b" main..HEAD

# Get file change statistics
git diff --stat main..HEAD

# Get the actual diff for understanding changes
git diff main..HEAD
```

### 2. Analyze the Changes

Based on the gathered information, determine:

- **What changed**: Categorize changes (features, fixes, refactors, docs, tests)
- **Why it changed**: Infer motivation from commit messages and code changes
- **Impact**: Breaking changes, new dependencies, migrations needed
- **Testing**: What tests were added/modified, how to verify manually

### 3. Check for Related Issues

Look for issue references:
- In commit messages (e.g., "fixes #123", "closes #456")
- In branch name (e.g., `fix/issue-123-description`)
- In code comments or TODOs addressed

### 4. Generate PR Description

Create the PR using this template structure:

```bash
gh pr create --title "<type>(<scope>): <description>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

<1-3 sentence overview of what this PR does and why>

## Changes

<Categorized bullet list of changes>

### Added
- <new features or capabilities>

### 5. Title Format

Use conventional commit format for the PR title:
- `feat(scope): add new feature`
- `fix(scope): correct bug behavior`
- `refactor(scope): restructure without behavior change`
- `docs(scope): update documentation`
- `test(scope): add or modify tests`
- `chore(scope): maintenance tasks`

### 6. Apply Labels

After creating the PR, apply appropriate labels based on the changes. Use `gh pr edit <number> --add-label <label>`.

Check the repository's available labels first:
```bash
gh label list
```

#### Common Type Labels

| Label | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `enhancement` | New features, capabilities, or improvements |
| `bug` | Bug fixes |
| `documentation` | Documentation-only changes |
| `breaking-change` | **User-facing** breaking changes requiring migration |

#### Breaking Change Criteria

Only apply `breaking-change` for **user-facing** changes that require users to modify their:
- Configuration files
- CLI invocations
- API integrations

Do NOT apply for internal refactors unless they affect external consumers.

### 7. After Creation

After creating the PR:
1. Display the PR URL with applied labels
2. Suggest adding reviewers if appropriate
3. Note if any CI checks need to pass

## Guidelines

**DO:**
- Be specific about what changed and why
- Include testing evidence
- Link related issues
- Note breaking changes prominently
- Remove empty optional sections

**DON'T:**
- Include irrelevant commits (keep PR focused)
- Leave placeholder text in the description
- Skip the testing section
- Create PRs without running local checks first
