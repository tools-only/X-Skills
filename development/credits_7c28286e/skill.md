## Key Concepts Credited

### Query Selectivity
The emphasis on indexed fields and selective filters comes from Salesforce's Query Plan Tool documentation and community performance optimization guides.

### Test Data Factory Pattern
The pattern of creating reusable test data factories is widely attributed to the Apex Enterprise Patterns community and documented in fflib.

### 251 Record Testing
The requirement to test with 251+ records (beyond the 200 batch boundary) is a community-established best practice for validating bulk behavior.
