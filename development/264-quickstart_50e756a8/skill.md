## Troubleshooting

### Skills Not Activating
1. Restart Claude Code after installation
2. Check skill files exist: `ls ~/.claude/skills/`
3. Be more specific with framework/technology names
4. Try explicitly mentioning the skill name: "Use the NestJS Expert to help me..."

### Skills Not Loading After Install
1. Verify the plugin is installed: `/plugin list`
2. Check for conflicting skill names in `~/.claude/skills/`
3. Try reinstalling: `/plugin uninstall fullstack-dev-skills@jeffallan` then reinstall

### How to Update
```bash
# Marketplace installs update automatically
# For manual installs, pull latest and re-copy:
cd claude-skills && git pull
cp -r ./skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```
