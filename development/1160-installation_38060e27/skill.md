## Multi-CLI Support

The Developer Kit supports installation across multiple AI-powered development environments through a unified **multi-plugin Makefile interface**.

### Prerequisites

**jq (JSON Processor)** - Required for plugin discovery
```bash
# macOS
brew install jq

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install jq

# Verify installation
jq --version
```

### Quick Start with Makefile

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/giuseppe-trisciuoglio/developer-kit.git
cd developer-kit

# Check dependencies
make check-deps

# See all available options
make help

# Discover available plugins
make list-plugins

# Install for your specific CLI tool
make install-claude       # For Claude Code (interactive, project-local)
make install-opencode     # For OpenCode CLI (global)
make install-copilot      # For GitHub Copilot CLI (global)
make install-codex        # For Codex CLI (global)
make install              # Auto-install for all detected CLIs
```

### What's New in Multi-Plugin Architecture

The Developer Kit now uses a **plugin-based architecture** with 10 separate plugins:

- **developer-kit** - Core agents, commands, and skills (6 agents, 17 commands, 2 skills)
- **developer-kit-java** - Java/Spring Boot/LangChain4J/AWS Lambda integration (9 agents, 11 commands, 49 skills)
- **developer-kit-typescript** - TypeScript/NestJS/React/Next.js/Drizzle/Monorepo (13 agents, 3 commands, 16 skills)
- **developer-kit-python** - Python/AWS Lambda capabilities (4 agents, 2 skills)
- **developer-kit-php** - PHP/WordPress/AWS Lambda (5 agents, 3 skills)
- **developer-kit-aws** - AWS/CloudFormation (3 agents, 16 skills)
- **developer-kit-ai** - Prompt engineering/RAG/chunking (1 agent, 1 command, 3 skills)
- **developer-kit-devops** - Docker/GitHub Actions (2 agents)
- **developer-kit-project-management** - LRA workflow (1 command)
- **github-spec-kit** - GitHub specifications (3 commands)

**Total Components:** 43 agents, 36 commands, 91 skills across all plugins

| Plugin | Agents | Commands | Skills |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| developer-kit | 6 | 17 | 2 |
| developer-kit-java | 9 | 11 | 49 |
| developer-kit-typescript | 13 | 3 | 16 |
| developer-kit-python | 4 | 0 | 2 |
| developer-kit-php | 5 | 0 | 3 |
| developer-kit-aws | 3 | 0 | 16 |
| developer-kit-ai | 1 | 1 | 3 |
| developer-kit-devops | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| developer-kit-project-management | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| github-spec-kit | 0 | 3 | 0 |
| **Total** | **43** | **36** | **91** |

**Plugin Discovery:** The Makefile automatically scans `plugins/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` files to discover all available plugins and their components (agents, commands, skills).

### Supported CLI Tools

#### GitHub Copilot CLI

```bash
make install-copilot

# Installation creates:

```

**Features:**
- **Multi-Plugin Support**: Automatically installs agents and skills from all 10 plugins
- **Specialized Agents**: Code review, architecture, security, testing, debugging experts
- **Usage**: `/agent` to select agents or mention in prompts
- **Integration**: Works with Copilot's native agent system
- **⚠️ Important**: Commands are NOT installed (Copilot CLI does not support commands)

#### OpenCode CLI

```bash
make install-opencode

# Installation creates:
# ~/.config/opencode/agent/     # All discovered agents from plugins
# ~/.config/opencode/command/  # All discovered commands from plugins (with subdirs)
# ~/.config/opencode/skills/   # All discovered skills from plugins
```

**Features:**

#### Codex CLI

```bash
make install-codex

# Installation creates:
# ~/.codex/skills/           # All discovered skills from plugins
# ~/.codex/AGENTS.md         # Auto-generated index of all skills
```

**Features:**
- **Multi-Plugin Support**: Automatically installs skills from all 10 plugins

## Management Commands

### Status & Information

```bash
# Check installation status for all CLIs
make status

# List all discovered plugins
make list-plugins

# List components of a specific plugin
make list-components PLUGIN=developer-kit-java

# List all available agents
make list-agents

# List all available commands
make list-commands

# List all available skills
make list-skills
```

### Backup & Uninstall

```bash
# Create backup before installing
make backup
# Creates timestamped backup in ~/.devkit-backups/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/

# Remove all Developer Kit installations
make uninstall
# Removes only files installed by Developer Kit (preserves configs)

# Check dependencies
make check-deps
# Verifies jq is installed
```

### Manual Installation

For manual installation or custom setups, you can copy components directly:

```bash
# Set your target project
TARGET_PROJECT="/path/to/your/project"
TARGET_DIR="$TARGET_PROJECT/.claude"

# Create directory structure
mkdir -p "$TARGET_DIR"/{agents,commands,skills}

# Install developer-kit (core plugin)
PLUGIN_DIR="plugins/developer-kit"

# Copy agents (6 agents)
cp $PLUGIN_DIR/agents/*.md "$TARGET_DIR/agents/"

# Copy commands (17 commands, preserving subdirectories)
cp -r $PLUGIN_DIR/commands/* "$TARGET_DIR/commands/"

# Copy skills (if any)
cp -r $PLUGIN_DIR/skills/* "$TARGET_DIR/skills/" 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Install Multiple Plugins:**

```bash
# Install all plugins
for plugin in plugins/*/; do
    echo "Installing from: $plugin"
    cp "$plugin"agents/*.md "$TARGET_DIR/agents/" 2>/dev/null || true
    cp -r "$plugin"commands/* "$TARGET_DIR/commands/" 2>/dev/null || true
    cp -r "$plugin"skills/* "$TARGET_DIR/skills/" 2>/dev/null || true
done
```

**Verification:**

```bash
# Check installed components
ls -1 "$TARGET_DIR/agents/" | wc -l      # Should show 43+ agents
ls -1 "$TARGET_DIR/commands/" | wc -l     # Should show 37+ commands
ls -1d "$TARGET_DIR/skills/"* | wc -l     # Should show 77+ skills
```

### Installation Safety

- **Automatic Backups**: Creates timestamped backups before installation
- **Plugin Validation**: Skips invalid plugin.json files with warnings
- **Conflict Resolution**: Interactive prompts for existing files (overwrite/skip/rename)
- **Rollback Support**: Easy uninstall to restore previous state
- **Component Filtering**: Each CLI receives only supported components
  - **Claude Code**: agents + commands + skills (all)
  - **OpenCode**: agents + commands + skills (all)
  - **Copilot**: agents + skills (NO commands)
  - **Codex**: skills only (NO agents, NO commands)
