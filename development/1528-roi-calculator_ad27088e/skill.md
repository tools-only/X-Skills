## 🎯 Quick ROI Summary

**Break-Even Point**: Save **2-3 hours per month** to cover the $19/user/month subscription cost.

**Typical ROI**: 5-15x return on investment for active IaC developers.

**Why so fast?** At $19/month per user (~$0.12/hour for a full-time employee), even saving 10 minutes per day covers the
cost. Most IT Pros report saving 1-2 hours on their first day.

## 🧮 ROI Calculator Worksheet

### Step 1: Enter Your Team Details

| Input                   | Your Value  | Example | Notes                                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Number of IT Pros**   | **\_**      | 5       | Cloud architects, infra engineers, DevOps        |
| **Average hourly rate** | $**\_** /hr | $100    | Fully loaded cost (salary + benefits + overhead) |
| **Working hours/month** | **\_**      | 160     | Standard assumption                              |

---

### Step 2: Estimate Current Time Allocation

_Based on research, IT Pros typically spend their time as follows. Adjust percentages to match your reality._

| Task Category                             | Industry Avg | Your Team % | Hours/Month (per person) |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| IaC Development (Bicep, ARM)              | 25%          | **\_**%     | **\_** hrs               |
| Scripting & Automation (PowerShell, Bash) | 15%          | **\_**%     | **\_** hrs               |
| Troubleshooting & Debugging               | 20%          | **\_**%     | **\_** hrs               |
| Documentation                             | 15%          | **\_**%     | **\_** hrs               |
| Research & Learning                       | 15%          | **\_**%     | **\_** hrs               |
| Strategic Architecture                    | 10%          | **\_**%     | **\_** hrs               |
| **TOTAL**                                 | 100%         | 100%        | 160 hrs                  |

---

### Step 3: Apply Time Savings Multipliers

_Research-backed savings percentages. Use conservative (low) estimates for pilot planning._

| Task Category          | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive | Your Estimate |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| IaC Development        | 60%          | 75%      | 85%        | **\_**%       |
| Scripting & Automation | 55%          | 70%      | 80%        | **\_**%       |
| Troubleshooting        | 50%          | 65%      | 80%        | **\_**%       |
| Documentation          | 65%          | 80%      | 90%        | **\_**%       |
| Research & Learning    | 40%          | 55%      | 70%        | **\_**%       |

**Research Sources:**

- GitHub Copilot Study (2023): 55% task completion improvement

### Step 4: Calculate Monthly Savings

**Formula:**

```text
Hours Saved = (Current Hours × Savings %) for each task category
Monthly Value = Total Hours Saved × Hourly Rate
```

| Task Category          | Current Hrs | Savings % | Hours Saved        | Value Saved     |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| IaC Development        | **\_**      | **\_**%   | **\_**             | $**\_**         |
| Scripting & Automation | **\_**      | **\_**%   | **\_**             | $**\_**         |
| Troubleshooting        | **\_**      | **\_**%   | **\_**             | $**\_**         |
| Documentation          | **\_**      | **\_**%   | **\_**             | $**\_**         |
| Research & Learning    | **\_**      | **\_**%   | **\_**             | $**\_**         |
| **TOTAL per IT Pro**   |             |           | \***\*\_** hrs\*\* | **$**\_\*\*\*\* |

### Step 5: Calculate Team ROI

| Metric                         | Calculation                | Result        |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Monthly savings per IT Pro** | From Step 4                | $**\_**       |
| **Team size**                  | From Step 1                | **\_** people |
| **Total monthly savings**      | Savings × Team size        | $**\_**       |
| **GitHub Copilot cost**        | $19 × Team size            | $**\_**       |
| **Net monthly benefit**        | Savings - Cost             | $**\_**       |
| **Monthly ROI**                | (Net benefit ÷ Cost) × 100 | **\_**%       |

## 🎯 Presenting ROI to Stakeholders

### For Technical Leaders

- Specific time savings per task type
- Quality improvements (fewer incidents)
- Team productivity and morale

### For Financial Leaders

- Hard dollar savings (hours × rate)
- Break-even timeline (typically < 1 month)
- Comparison to other productivity investments

### For Executive Leadership

- Strategic value (faster delivery, reduced risk)

- Talent attraction and retention

### Key Messages

1. **"Break-even in hours, not months"** — Unlike most software investments, Copilot pays for itself almost
   immediately.

2. **"Not a productivity tax"** — Learning curve is minimal (1-2 days), and productivity gains are visible from day
   one.

3. **"Multiplies existing expertise"** — Your senior architects can now implement their own designs. Junior staff
   learn faster.

4. **"Risk is minimal"** — At $19/user/month with month-to-month billing, you can pilot with zero commitment.

## 🔢 Quick Reference Formulas

```text
Monthly Copilot Cost = Engineers × $19

Monthly Hours Saved = Projects × Avg_Project_Hours × 0.85 × Adoption_Rate

Monthly Dollar Savings = Hours_Saved × Hourly_Rate

Monthly Net Savings = Dollar_Savings - Copilot_Cost

Annual Net Savings = Monthly_Net_Savings × 12

ROI Percentage = (Net_Savings / Copilot_Cost) × 100

Break-Even Hours = $19 / Hourly_Rate
  (Example: $19 / $100 = 0.19 hours = 11 minutes saved per month to break even)
```
