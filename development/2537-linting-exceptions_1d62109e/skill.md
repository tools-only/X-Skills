# Linting Exception Conditions

Resolve linting errors — do not suppress them. Linting errors signal architectural issues, not noise.

## Acceptable Exceptions

Fix linting issues unless code falls into these categories:

1. **Vendored code** — third-party code copied without modification (not authored by model)
2. **What-not-to-do examples** — intentionally incorrect code for educational/negative test cases
3. **Historic Python version pinning** — code for Python <3.11 where modern syntax unavailable (currently no code in this category — verify before assuming)
4. **Python derivatives** — CircuitPython, MicroPython, or implementations with different syntax/missing stdlib modules

For these exceptions: update linting config files (`pyproject.toml`, `.vscode/settings.json`) to exclude the files. Do not use inline comments (`# noqa`, `# type: ignore`).

## Unacceptable Exceptions (MUST fix or escalate)

If NONE of the above apply:

1. Fix linting smell using `/hollistic-linting:hollistic-linting` Skill (exact methodology for addressing linting issues)
2. If unable to fix, document specific blocker
3. Adding `# type: ignore` or `# noqa` requires explicit user approval

## Rule Codes That MUST Always Be Fixed (never suppress)

- BLE001 (blind-except): Replace `except Exception` with specific exception types
- D103 (missing-docstring-in-public-function): Add docstrings to public functions
- TRY300 (try-consider-else): Restructure try/except/else blocks properly

## Per-File Exceptions in pyproject.toml (acceptable)

- `**/scripts/**`: T201 (print), S (security), DOC, ANN401, PLR0911, PLR0917, PLC0415
- `**/tests/**`: S, D, E501, ANN, DOC, PLC, SLF, PLR, EXE, N, T
- `**/assets/**`: PLC0415, DOC
- `typings/**`: N, ANN, A

**Touched Files Must Be Clean**: When files are modified/moved/renamed, all linting issues MUST be resolved before committing. Touching a file means taking responsibility for its quality.
