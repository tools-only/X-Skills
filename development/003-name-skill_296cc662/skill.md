# Navigator Marker Skill

Create context markers - save points that preserve conversation state so you can resume work later without re-explaining everything.

## When to Invoke

Invoke this skill when the user:
- Says "save my progress", "create checkpoint", "mark this"
- Says "before I take a break", "save before lunch"
- Mentions "risky refactor ahead", "experiment with new approach"
- Says "end of day", "stopping for today"
- Before compacting context

**DO NOT invoke** if:
- User is asking about existing markers (use listing, not creation)
- Context is fresh (< 5 messages exchanged)

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Check Navigator Structure

Verify `.agent/.context-markers/` directory exists:

```bash
mkdir -p .agent/.context-markers
```

### Step 2: Determine Marker Name

**If user provided name**:
- Use their name (sanitize: lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
- Example: "Before Big Refactor" → "before-big-refactor"

**If no name provided**:
- Auto-generate with timestamp: `marker-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HHmm}`
- Example: `marker-2025-10-16-1430`

**Ask user for optional note**:
```
Creating marker: [name]

Add a note? (optional - helps remember context later)
Example: "OAuth working, need to add tests"

Note:
```

### Step 3: Generate Marker Content [EXECUTE]

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST actively capture ToM sections (User Intent, Corrections, Belief State).

Create marker document with this structure:

```markdown
# Context Marker: [name]

**Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Note**: [user's note or "No note provided"]

## Conversation Summary

[Summarize last 10-15 messages:
- What user was working on
- Key decisions made
- Problems solved
- Current progress state
]

## Documentation Loaded

[List docs that were Read during session:
- Navigator: ✅ .agent/DEVELOPMENT-README.md
- Task: TASK-XX-feature.md
- System: project-architecture.md
- SOPs: [if any]
]

## Files Modified

[List files with Write/Edit calls:
- src/auth/login.ts (implemented OAuth)
- src/routes/auth.ts (added endpoints)
- tests/auth.test.ts (created tests)
]

## Current Focus

[What user is working on right now:
- Feature: Authentication with OAuth
- Phase: Integration complete, testing pending
- Blockers: [if any]
]

## Technical Decisions

[Key architectural choices:
- Using passport.js over next-auth (better control)
- JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies (XSS protection)
- Redis for session storage (scalability)
]

## Next Steps

[What to do after restore:
1. Finish writing tests for OAuth flow
2. Add error handling for failed logins
3. Document setup in README
]

## User Intent & Goals (ToM) [CAPTURE ACTIVELY]

[Theory of Mind section - captures user's mental state for better restoration]

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Analyze conversation to extract these - do not leave empty!**

**Primary goal this session**:
[What the user was ultimately trying to accomplish - not just the surface task]
- Review conversation for "I want to...", "The goal is...", "We need to..."
- Infer from task context if not explicitly stated

**Stated preferences**:
[Any preferences expressed during session:
- Communication style (concise/detailed)
- Code patterns preferred
- Confirmation behavior wanted
]
- Look for "I prefer...", "Don't do...", "Always use..."

**Corrections made**:
[Important corrections that should persist:
- "Should be /users not /user (plural convention)"
- "Prefer functional components over class"
- "Always use TypeScript strict mode"
]
- Look for "No, I meant...", "Actually...", "Not X, use Y"
- These MUST be captured to avoid repeating mistakes

## Belief State [CAPTURE ACTIVELY]

[Captures mutual understanding state for accurate restoration]

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Infer from conversation - do not leave empty!**

**What user knows**:
[User's demonstrated knowledge level:
- Familiar with Express, new to Passport
- Knows about JWT, unfamiliar with refresh tokens
- Senior developer, skip basics
]

**Assumptions I made**:
[Key assumptions during session:
- Using Redis for sessions (confirmed by user)
- Auth endpoints follow /api/auth/* pattern
- Testing with Jest + React Testing Library
]

**Uncertainty areas**:
[Questions that weren't fully resolved:
- Not sure if user wants social logins beyond Google
- Rate limiting requirements unclear
- Error message format preferences unknown
]

## Loop State (if in loop mode)

[Capture loop mode state for resumption - skip if not in loop mode]

**Iteration**: [N]/[MAX] (e.g., 3/5)
**Phase**: [INIT|RESEARCH|IMPL|VERIFY|COMPLETE]
**State Hash**: [6-char hash for continuity]
**Completion Indicators**:
- [ ] Code committed
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Ticket closed
- [ ] Marker created

**EXIT_SIGNAL**: [true/false]
**Stagnation Count**: [N]/[THRESHOLD]

## Knowledge Graph State (v6.0.0+)

[Capture graph state for restoration - skip if no knowledge graph]

**Check if graph exists**:
```bash
if [ -f ".agent/knowledge/graph.json" ]; then
  python3 skills/nav-graph/functions/graph_manager.py --action stats --graph-path .agent/knowledge/graph.json
fi
```

**Memories surfaced this session**:
[List memories that were queried or created:
- mem-001: "Auth changes break session tests" (surfaced)
- mem-002: "Use plural REST endpoints" (created from correction)
]

**Concepts active**:
[Concepts relevant to current work:
- authentication
- testing
- api
]

**Graph queries made**:
[Knowledge graph queries from this session:
- "What do we know about auth?" → 3 tasks, 1 memory
]

This allows restoration to re-surface relevant memories when resuming.

## Restore Instructions

To restore this marker:
\```bash
Read .agent/.context-markers/[filename]
\```

Or use: `/nav:markers` and select this marker
```

### Step 4: Save Marker File

Write marker to file:

```
Write(
  file_path: ".agent/.context-markers/[timestamp]_[name].md",
  content: [generated marker content]
)
```

Filename format: `{YYYY-MM-DD-HHmm}_{name}.md`
Example: `2025-10-16-1430_before-big-refactor.md`

### Step 4.5: Verify Marker Creation

After creating marker, verify it was written successfully:

```bash
# Verify file exists and is non-empty
if [ -f ".agent/.context-markers/[filename]" ] && [ -s ".agent/.context-markers/[filename]" ]; then
  # Calculate checksum for verification
  checksum=$(md5 -q ".agent/.context-markers/[filename]" 2>/dev/null || md5sum ".agent/.context-markers/[filename]" | cut -d' ' -f1)

  # Log to central marker log
  echo "[$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")] ✅ Marker created: [filename] (checksum: $checksum)" >> .agent/.marker-log

  echo "✅ Marker verified successfully"
else
  echo "❌ Marker creation failed - file missing or empty"
  exit 1
fi
```

Marker verification ensures:
- File exists on disk
- File has content (non-empty)
- Checksum logged for integrity verification
- Creation event logged to central log

### Step 5: Confirm Creation

Show success message with verification details:

```
✅ Context marker created!

Marker: [name]
File: .agent/.context-markers/[filename]
Size: [X] KB (~[Y] tokens)
Checksum: [md5-hash]
Verified: ✅

This marker captures:
- Last [N] messages of conversation
- Files you were working on
- Technical decisions made
- Next steps to continue

To restore later:
- Start new session
- Say "load marker [name]"
- Or use /nav:markers to list all markers

Logged to: .agent/.marker-log
```

## Scripts

**create_marker.py**: Generates marker content from conversation analysis
- Input: Conversation history (from Claude)
- Output: Formatted markdown marker

## Common Use Cases

### Before Lunch Break
```
User: "Save my progress, taking lunch"
→ Creates marker: "lunch-break-2025-10-16"
→ Captures current state
→ User resumes after lunch: "Load my lunch marker"
```

### Before Risky Refactor
```
User: "Mark this before I refactor routing"
→ Creates marker: "before-routing-refactor"
→ If refactor fails, restore marker
→ If refactor succeeds, delete marker
```

### End of Day
```
User: "End of day checkpoint"
→ Creates marker: "eod-2025-10-16"
→ Note: "OAuth done, tests tomorrow"
→ Next morning: "Load yesterday's marker"
```

### Before Context Compact
```
Automatic (via nav-compact skill):
→ Creates marker: "before-compact-2025-10-16-1500"
→ Compact clears conversation
→ Marker preserves knowledge
→ Next session: Auto-offers to restore
```

## Marker Best Practices

**Good marker names**:
- `lunch-break` (clear when/why)
- `before-api-refactor` (indicates purpose)
- `feature-complete` (marks milestone)
- `eod-friday` (specific timing)

**Bad marker names**:
- `temp` (not descriptive)
- `marker1` (meaningless)
- `test` (confusing)

**When to create markers**:
- ✅ Before breaks (lunch, EOD)
- ✅ Before risky changes
- ✅ Before context compact
- ✅ At milestones (feature complete)
- ❌ After every single message (noise)
- ❌ When context is fresh (< 5 messages)

## Error Handling

**Marker directory missing**:
```
Creating .agent/.context-markers/ directory...
✅ Ready to save markers
```

**Duplicate marker name**:
```
⚠️  Marker "[name]" already exists

Options:
1. Overwrite (replace existing)
2. Append timestamp (create "[name]-v2")
3. Choose different name

Your choice [1-3]:
```

**Insufficient context**:
```
⚠️  Very little context to save (< 5 messages)

Markers work best when there's significant progress to preserve.
Continue anyway? [y/N]:
```

## Success Criteria

Marker creation is successful when:
- [ ] Marker file created in `.agent/.context-markers/`
- [ ] Filename is unique and descriptive
- [ ] Content includes: summary, loaded docs, files modified, next steps
- [ ] User knows how to restore marker later
- [ ] Marker is 2-5k tokens (comprehensive but efficient)

## Notes

- Markers are **git-ignored** (personal session save points)
- Team members don't see each other's markers
- Markers can be deleted anytime with `/nav:markers clean`
- Typical marker size: 2-5k tokens (97.7% compression from 130k conversation)

This skill provides same functionality as `/nav:marker` command but with natural language invocation.
