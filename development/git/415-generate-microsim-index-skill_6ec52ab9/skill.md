# Prompt Used to Generate the MicroSim Index Feature of the MicroSim-Util Skill

!!! prompt
    Use the skill creator skill to create a new feature of an existing     
    skill.  The current skill is @skills/microsim-utils The new            
    feature I want is a process that builds a nice index.md page that      
    has informative grid cells that describe each microsim.  To do         
    this we need to use the mkdocs-material grid layout.  There is an      
    example of this format here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmc     
    creary/intro-to-physics-course/refs/heads/main/docs/sims/index.md.     
    If the user says "update the microsim listings" or "update the         
    list of microsims" or "Create a grid view of all the microsims" or     
    "generate a listing of all the microsims" this new feature should      
    be invoked.  Note that the title is also a link and the image          
    comes after the title/link.  After the image is a short descripton     
    of the MicroSim taken from the microsim index.md yml metadata          
    "description" field.  For any microsims that are missing the           
    description, please add it.  For any microsims that are missing        
    the image, use the ~/.local/bin/bk-capture-screenshot shell            
    script. Verify that the screen capture worked and if it did not        
    work, create a TODO.md record in the @docs/sims directory.  Log        
    the skill updates to logs/generate-microsim-index-skill.md
