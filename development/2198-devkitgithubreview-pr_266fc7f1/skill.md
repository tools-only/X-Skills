echo "State: $PR_STATE"
echo "Branch: $PR_HEAD -> $PR_BASE"
echo "Changes: +$PR_ADDITIONS -$PR_DELETIONS across $PR_CHANGED_FILES files"
```

### 1.2 Get Changed Files

```bash
# Get list of changed files with their status
gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER --name-only > changed_files.tmp

echo ""
echo "Changed files:"
cat changed_files.tmp
echo ""

# Categorize files by type
JAVA_FILES=$(grep '\.java$' changed_files.tmp | wc -l)

PY_FILES=$(grep '\.py$' changed_files.tmp | wc -l)
CONFIG_FILES=$(grep -E '\.(xml|yml|yaml|json|properties)$' changed_files.tmp | wc -l)
TEST_FILES=$(grep -i 'test' changed_files.tmp | wc -l)
DOC_FILES=$(grep -E '\.(md|txt|adoc)$' changed_files.tmp | wc -l)

echo "File types:"
echo "- Java files: $JAVA_FILES"
echo "- JavaScript/TypeScript files: $JS_FILES"
echo "- Python files: $PY_FILES"
echo "- Configuration files: $CONFIG_FILES"
echo "- Test files: $TEST_FILES"
echo "- Documentation files: $DOC_FILES"
```

# Get diff statistics
TOTAL_LINES=$(wc -l < pr_diff.tmp)
ADDED_LINES=$(grep '^+' pr_diff.tmp | grep -v '^+++' | wc -l)
REMOVED_LINES=$(grep '^-' pr_diff.tmp | grep -v '^---' | wc -l)

echo ""
echo "Diff statistics:"
echo "- Total lines in diff: $TOTAL_LINES"
echo "- Lines added: $ADDED_LINES"
echo "- Lines removed: $REMOVED_LINES"
echo ""
```

## Phase 2: Code Quality Analysis

### 2.1 Code Structure and Organization

Analyze:

- **Package/module structure**: Logical organization and naming

- **Output encoding**: Preventing injection attacks
- **Cryptography**: Strong algorithms and key management
- **Session management**: Secure session handling
- **Error messages**: No sensitive information leakage
- **HTTPS usage**: Secure communication enforcement

### 3.3 Secrets Detection

```bash
# Check for potential secrets in diff
echo "Scanning for potential secrets..."

# Common secret patterns
grep -iE '(password|secret|api_key|access_key|private_key|token)\s*[:=]' pr_diff.tmp > secrets.tmp || true

if [ -s secrets.tmp ]; then
    echo "WARNING: Potential secrets found:"
    cat secrets.tmp
else
    echo "No obvious secrets detected"
fi
```

## Phase 4: Performance Analysis

### 4.1 Performance Concerns

Identify:

- **N+1 queries**: Database query inefficiencies
- **Memory leaks**: Unclosed resources, retained references
- **Inefficient algorithms**: O(n²) or worse complexity
- **Unnecessary computations**: Redundant calculations
- **Large data structures**: Excessive memory usage
- **Blocking operations**: Synchronous calls in async contexts

Look for:

- **Caching opportunities**: Repeated expensive operations
- **Lazy loading**: Deferred resource loading
- **Batch operations**: Combining multiple operations
- **Index usage**: Database query optimization
- **Resource pooling**: Connection and thread pools
- **Async processing**: Non-blocking operations

## Phase 5: Testing Review

### 5.1 Test Coverage Analysis

```bash
# Check for test files in PR
echo ""
echo "Test file analysis:"

TEST_FILES_IN_PR=$(grep -i 'test' changed_files.tmp | wc -l)
SRC_FILES_IN_PR=$(grep -v -i 'test' changed_files.tmp | wc -l)

TEST_RATIO=$(echo "scale=2; $TEST_FILES_IN_PR / $SRC_FILES_IN_PR" | bc 2>/dev/null || echo "N/A")

echo "- Test files: $TEST_FILES_IN_PR"
echo "- Source files: $SRC_FILES_IN_PR"
echo "- Test ratio: $TEST_RATIO"
```
