# Install PolicyEngine spinner verbs

Install PolicyEngine-themed spinner verbs (the loading messages that appear while Claude is thinking) into the user's `~/.claude/settings.json`.

## Steps

1. Read the user's current `~/.claude/settings.json`
2. Check if `spinnerVerbs` is already configured
3. If already configured, show the user what's there and ask if they want to replace it
4. If not configured (or user confirms replacement), merge the following `spinnerVerbs` block into their settings JSON, preserving all other existing settings:

```json
"spinnerVerbs": {
  "mode": "replace",
  "verbs": [
    "Microsimulating",
    "Means-testing",
    "Phasing out benefits",
    "Calculating MTRs",
    "Clawing back subsidies",
    "Navigating the subsidy cliff",
    "Modeling counterfactuals",
    "Imputing income",
    "Reweighting the CPS",
    "Parsing the CFR",
    "Adjudicating eligibility",
    "Benchmarking silver plans",
    "Risk-adjusting",
    "Sunsetting provisions",
    "Scoring the bill",
    "Applying the benefit reduction rate",
    "Overfitting",
    "Simulating takeup",
    "Inflation adjusting",
    "Ignoring behavioral responses",
    "Querying HMRC",
    "Means-testing the telly licence",
    "Freezing the thresholds",
    "Preserving the triple lock",
    "Scoring the autumn budget",
    "Estimating impacts",
    "Building the baseline",
    "Reforming the tax code",
    "Calculating taxes",
    "Simulating policy",
    "Crunching the numbers"
  ]
}
```

5. Write the updated JSON back to `~/.claude/settings.json` with proper formatting (2-space indent)
6. Tell the user the verbs are installed and they'll see them next time Claude is thinking

**IMPORTANT:** Preserve all existing settings (permissions, hooks, enabledPlugins, etc.). Only add or replace the `spinnerVerbs` key.
