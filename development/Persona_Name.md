# Claude Skillz Project Guidelines

## System Prompt Composability

System prompts follow a composable architecture where skills are loaded efficiently at session startup.

### Structure

System prompts should contain:

1. **Persona definition** - expertise, idols, philosophy, collaboration style
2. **Skills section** - @ references to skill files (processed by launcher)
3. **Domain-specific knowledge** - content NOT duplicated in any skill

### How It Works

**@ Reference Processing:**
- The `claude-launcher` pre-processes @ references before launching Claude Code
- Skills are embedded directly into the system prompt (not loaded via Read operations)
- A "Loaded Skills" manifest is added at the top showing what was loaded
- Debug output saved to `/tmp/claude-launcher-debug.md` for verification

**Token Efficiency:**
- Pre-processing avoids 18k+ tokens of message history overhead
- Near-zero overhead vs monolithic prompts (1% difference)
- Skills remain composable and reusable across personas

### Creating Composable System Prompts

**🚨 CRITICAL: System Prompts Are Instructions, Not Descriptions**

System prompts tell Claude what to do. Write them as directives and imperatives, not as narrative descriptions.

❌ **WRONG (descriptive):**
```
You are a helpful assistant who researches solutions carefully. Your philosophy emphasizes clarity.
```

✅ **RIGHT (instructive):**
```
Research before recommending. Never guess at capabilities.
Be maximally clear in all communication.
```

System prompts are active instructions that shape behavior. Use imperatives. Be direct.

**Pattern:**
```markdown
---
name: Persona Name
shortcut: xxx
---

[Direct instructions about your behavior and principles]

Your core approach:
- [Instruction 1]
- [Instruction 2]
- [Instruction 3]

---

## Skills

- @../skill-name/SKILL.md
- @../another-skill/SKILL.md
```

**Rules:**
- Write as instructions, not descriptions
- Never duplicate skill content in system prompts
- Use @ references for reusable behavioral instructions
- Keep domain knowledge specific to this persona only
- Include metadata frontmatter: `name` and `shortcut` (3 chars)

### Example

See `/system-prompts/super-tdd-developer.md` for the reference pattern.

## Marketplace Plugin Distribution

This repo is a Claude Code plugin marketplace. When adding new skills or plugins:

### Adding New Skills

1. Create skill directory with `SKILL.md`
2. Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` - add to `development-skills.skills` array:
   ```json
   "skills": [
     "./tdd-process",
     "./your-new-skill"
   ]
   ```

### Skill Structure: Always Include a Checklist

**Every skill MUST end with a mandatory checklist.** Checklists make skills actionable and verifiable.

**Why checklists matter:**
- Turn abstract principles into concrete verification steps
- Ensure Claude systematically applies the skill
- Make compliance measurable
- Catch violations before they ship

**Checklist format:**
```markdown
## Mandatory Checklist

When [designing/implementing/reviewing], complete this checklist:

1. [ ] Verify [specific condition]
2. [ ] Verify [another condition]
3. [ ] Verify [etc.]

Do not proceed until all checks pass.
```

**Checklist rules:**
- Use numbered items (not bullets)
- Start each item with "Verify" (action-oriented)
- Be specific and unambiguous
- Place at the END of the skill (final thing Claude sees)

**Reference:** See `separation-of-concerns/SKILL.md` or `tactical-ddd/SKILL.md` for examples.

### Adding New Plugins

1. Create plugin directory with `commands/`, `agents/`, or `hooks/`
2. Add plugin entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "plugin-name",
     "source": "./plugin-directory",
     "description": "Brief description",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "category": "productivity|development",
     "keywords": ["tag1", "tag2"]
   }
   ```

Keep marketplace.json updated so users can install via `/plugin install <name>@claude-skillz`.

## Version Management (MANDATORY)

When making ANY change to this repository, you MUST increment versions in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

### Which version to bump:

1. **Modifying a skill** (e.g., `tdd-process/SKILL.md`):
   → Bump the `version` of the plugin that contains it (e.g., `development-skills`)

2. **Modifying a plugin** (e.g., `track-and-improve/commands/`):
   → Bump that plugin's individual `version` field

3. **Adding a new plugin**:
   → Set new plugin version to "1.0.0"
   → Bump `metadata.version`

### Format:
- Semantic versioning (e.g., "1.0.0" → "1.0.1")
- Patch for fixes, minor for features, major for breaking changes

**Why:** Claude Code caches plugins by their INDIVIDUAL version. Bumping only `metadata.version` does nothing—clients check the plugin's own `version` field to detect updates.
