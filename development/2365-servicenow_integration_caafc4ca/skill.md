# ServiceNow Integration Guide

**Version:** 0.237.005  
**Implemented in version:**0.237.005

## Overview

This guide documents the **single-agent integration** between Simple Chat and ServiceNow, enabling AI-powered incident management and knowledge base search through natural language prompts.

**This guide covers:**
- ✅ Incident management (create, update, query, statistics)
- ✅ Knowledge base search (read-only access)
- ✅ Single ServiceNow agent for standard support operations

**For advanced KB management (create/publish articles), see:**
- 📘 [TWO_AGENT_SETUP.md](TWO_AGENT_SETUP.md) - Recommended approach with separate KB Management agent
- 📘 [KB_MULTI_ACTION_SETUP.md](KB_MULTI_ACTION_SETUP.md) - Alternative multi-action approach

> **⚠️ Important - Work in Progress:**  
> This integration is under active development. **Check back regularly for updates** to the OpenAPI specifications and agent instructions. Unit testing of prompts is still in progress, so further changes to the spec files and agent instruction file are expected.

---

## Integration Architecture

**Approach:** Single-Agent Hybrid Integration
- **ServiceNow OpenAPI Actions** - Modular API integration for CRUD operations
- **ServiceNow Support Agent** - Specialized AI agent for incidents + read-only KB search

---

## Prerequisites

### Simple Chat Requirements
- ✅ Agents enabled (`enable_semantic_kernel: True`)
- ✅ Workspace Mode enabled (`per_user_semantic_kernel: True`)
- ✅ Global Actions enabled
- ✅ Application restarted after enabling Workspace Mode

### ServiceNow Requirements
- [ ] ServiceNow Developer Instance (Zurich - Latest release recommended)
- [ ] Integration user with API access
- [ ] API credentials (Basic Auth or OAuth 2.0)

---

## Phase 1: ServiceNow Instance Setup

### Step 1: Request Developer Instance

1. Navigate to: https://developer.servicenow.com/
2. Click "Request an Instance"
3. Select **Zurich (Latest release)**
4. Click "Request"
5. Wait for instance provisioning (typically 2-5 minutes)

**You'll receive:**
```
Instance URL: https://devXXXXX.service-now.com
Admin Username: admin
Admin Password: [provided by ServiceNow]
```

### Step 2: Create Integration User

> **Note:** This step demonstrates basic authentication setup for initial testing. For production deployments using Bearer Token authentication, refer to "SERVICENOW_OAUTH_SETUP.md".

1. Log into your ServiceNow instance as admin
2. Navigate to: **User Administration** → **Users**
3. Click **New** to create integration user:
   ```
   Username: simplechat6_servicenow_support_service
   First Name: Simple
   Last Name: Chat Integration
   Email: [your email]
   Time Zone: [your timezone]
   ```

4. Assign Roles:
   - Navigate to **Roles** tab
   - Add roles:
     - `rest_api_explorer` - For REST API access
     - `itil` - For incident management (basic create/read/update)
     - `knowledge` - For knowledge base read access
   
   **Optional Role for Enhanced Permissions:**
   - `incident_manager` - Add only if you need to:
     - Assign incidents to any user/group organization-wide
     - Close and resolve any incident (not just your own)
     - View all incidents across the organization
     - Escalate incidents and modify any incident assignments
     - Access incident analytics and reporting
   
   **Note:** For most AI agent use cases, `itil` + `knowledge` + `rest_api_explorer` is sufficient.

5. Set Password:
   - Click **Set Password**
   - Create secure password
   - **Password needs reset: ☐ UNCHECK THIS** (important for API access)
   - Save for later use

### Step 3: Test REST API Access

1. Navigate to: **System Web Services** → **REST** → **REST API Explorer**
2. URL: `https://devXXXXX.service-now.com/$restapi.do`
3. Select API: **Table API**
4. Select Table: **incident**
5. Click **Send** to test query
6. Verify you get JSON response with incident data

**Example successful response:**
```json
{
  "result": [
    {
      "number": "INC0000001",
      "short_description": "Test incident",
      "state": "1"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Phase 3: Simple Chat Configuration

> **📌 Important - Scope Options:**  
> ServiceNow actions and agents can be configured at different levels based on your organization's needs:
> 
> - **Global Actions/Agents**: Available to all users across the entire Simple Chat instance
> - **Group Actions/Agents**: Available only to members of specific workspaces/groups
> - **Personal Actions/Agents**: Available only to individual users
> 
> Choose the appropriate scope based on your security, governance, and access control requirements. For enterprise deployments, group-level configuration is recommended to control access by department or team.

### Step 1: Add ServiceNow Actions

> **Note:** This integration uses **two separate actions** because ServiceNow has distinct API endpoints for incident management and knowledge base operations, each with its own OpenAPI specification file.

1. Navigate to: **Admin Settings** → **Actions Configuration**
2. Click **"Add Action"**
3. **Select Action Type: OpenAPI**
   - ServiceNow REST APIs use OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
   - OpenAPI type supports: External API integration, HTTP/HTTPS requests, authentication, JSON payloads
   - Click **"Next"** after selecting OpenAPI

#### Action 1: Incident Management
```
Name: servicenow_manage_incident
Display Name: ServiceNow - Manage Incidents
Type: OpenAPI
Description: Complete incident management - query, create, update, retrieve details, and get statistics
OpenAPI Spec: [Upload sample_servicenow_incident_api.yaml or sample_servicenow_incident_api_basicauth.yaml]
Base URL: https://devXXXXX.service-now.com

Operations Included:
  - queryIncidents: Query/filter incidents with advanced search
  - createIncident: Create new incidents with all fields
  - getIncidentDetails: Retrieve full incident details by sys_id
  - updateIncident: Update incident state, assignments, work notes, etc.
  - getIncidentStats: Get aggregated statistics and metrics

Authentication Options:

Option A - Basic Auth (Testing Only):
  Auth Type: key
  Key: username:password (or use Key Vault reference)
  OpenAPI Spec File: sample_servicenow_incident_api_basicauth.yaml

Option B - OAuth Bearer Token (Recommended for Production):
  Auth Type: key
  Key: <oauth_access_token> (or use Key Vault reference)
  OpenAPI Spec File: sample_servicenow_incident_api.yaml
  See: SERVICENOW_OAUTH_SETUP.md for OAuth setup

Scope: Global or Group
```

**Repeat Step 1 for Knowledge Base Action:**

#### Action 2: Knowledge Base Search (Optional)
```
Name: servicenow_search_knowledge_base
Display Name: ServiceNow - Search Knowledge Base
Type: OpenAPI
Description: Search knowledge articles with progressive fallback and retrieve full article content
OpenAPI Spec: [Upload sample_now_knowledge_search_spec.yaml or sample_now_knowledge_search_spec_basicauth.yaml]
Base URL: https://devXXXXX.service-now.com

Operations Included:
  - searchKnowledgeFacets: Search KB articles with progressive search strategy
  - getKnowledgeArticle: Retrieve complete article content by sys_id

[Same auth config as above]

Scope: Global or Group
```

> **💡 Tip:** If you only need incident management without knowledge base search, you can skip Action 2 and configure your agent with only the `servicenow_manage_incident` action.

---

## Phase 4: Configure ServiceNow Agent

### Step 1: Create Agent

1. Navigate to: **Admin Settings** → **Agents Configuration**
2. Click **"Add Agent"**
3. Configure agent:

```

Instructions: [Copy from agent_instructions/servicenow_agent_instructions.txt]

Model: gpt-4o (or your preferred model)
Scope: Global or Group
```

> **📄 Agent Instructions File:** 
> - **Location:** `docs/how-to/agents/ServiceNow/agent_instructions/servicenow_agent_instructions.txt`
> - **Purpose:** Comprehensive behavioral instructions for the ServiceNow support agent
> - **Usage:** Copy the entire content from this file into the "Instructions" field when creating the agent
> 
> **⚠️ Important:** These instructions are continuously refined and tuned based on real-world use cases, agent behavior analysis, and production feedback. The file serves as a living reference that should be updated as new patterns emerge or edge cases are discovered. Regular review and updates ensure optimal agent performance and reliable ServiceNow interactions.

### Step 2: Attach Actions to Agent

1. Edit the ServiceNow Support Agent
2. Navigate to **Actions** tab
3. Select and attach:
   - ✅ servicenow_manage_incident
   - ✅ servicenow_search_knowledge_base
4. Save agent configuration

## Security Best Practices

### Credential Management

**Option 1: Direct Password Entry (Quick Setup)**
- Enter ServiceNow password directly in action configuration
- Stored encrypted in Cosmos DB
- ⚠️ Less secure for production use

**Option 2: Azure Key Vault (Recommended)**
1. Store ServiceNow credentials in Azure Key Vault
2. Create secret: `servicenow-integration-password`
3. Reference in action config: `@keyvault:servicenow-integration-password`
4. Simple Chat automatically retrieves from Key Vault

**Status:** [ ] Credentials secured

### API User Permissions

**Least Privilege Principle:**
- [ ] Integration user has only required roles
- [ ] Read-only access for query actions
- [ ] Write access only for create/update actions
- [ ] No admin privileges

### Audit Logging

**Enable in ServiceNow:**
1. Navigate to **System Logs** → **System Log** → **REST Messages**
2. Enable logging for API calls
3. Monitor for unusual activity

**Status:** [ ] Audit logging configured

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Session not authenticated" or "Session expired" error

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED in version 0.235.026**

**Symptoms:**
- Agent responds: "I'm unable to access your ServiceNow incidents because your session is not authenticated"
- Direct API calls with same credentials work correctly
- Base URL is configured correctly

**Root Cause:**
This issue was caused by a mismatch between how the Simple Chat UI stores Basic Auth credentials (as `username:password` in a single field) and how the OpenAPI plugin expected them (as separate `username` and `password` fields).

**Solution:**
The fix is included in Simple Chat v0.235.026+. The OpenAPI plugin factory now automatically transforms the authentication format when loading actions, so no user action is required.

**For detailed technical information, see:** `docs/explanation/fixes/OPENAPI_BASIC_AUTH_FIX.md`

#### Issue: "Authentication failed" error
**Solution:**
- Verify username (simplechat6_servicenow_support_service) and password are correct
- Check integration user is active
- Confirm user has `rest_api_explorer` role
- Test credentials in REST API Explorer first
- Ensure Base URL is correct: `https://devXXXXX.service-now.com/api/now`

#### Issue: "No results returned" for queries
**Solution:**
- Check date filters are correct
- Verify table name is correct (incident, not incidents)
- Test query in ServiceNow REST API Explorer
- Check sysparm_query encoding

#### Issue: Agent not using ServiceNow actions
**Solution:**
- Verify actions are attached to agent
- Check actions are saved as "Global" scope
- Restart application after configuration changes
- Review agent instructions for clarity

#### Issue: "Rate limit exceeded" error
**Solution:**
- ServiceNow limits API calls per hour
- Developer instances: ~10,000 calls/hour
- Add delays between bulk operations
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
