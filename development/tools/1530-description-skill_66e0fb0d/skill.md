# MCP Server Development

## Scope

TRIGGER: The model must activate when building MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers

SPECIALIZATION: FastMCP framework (Python, decorator-based) FALLBACK: Generic Python SDK, TypeScript SDK also covered

COVERAGE:

- Generic MCP protocol (all implementations)
- Agent-centric design principles
- FastMCP framework (Python, decorator-based, Pydantic validation)
- TypeScript/Node MCP SDK (Zod validation)
- Evaluation creation for testing server quality
- Production deployment and packaging
- Security, performance, and observability patterns

EXCLUSIONS:

- Low-level MCP transport layer details (handled by SDKs/frameworks)
- Client-side MCP implementations

## High-Level Workflow

TRIGGER: The model must follow this 4-phase workflow when building MCP servers

### Phase 1: Deep Research and Planning

#### 1.1 Understand Agent-Centric Design Principles

RULE: The model must design tools for AI agents, not just API wrappers

PRINCIPLES:

**Build for Workflows, Not Just API Endpoints:**

- Don't simply wrap existing API endpoints
- Build thoughtful, high-impact workflow tools
- Consolidate related operations (e.g., `schedule_event` that both checks availability and creates event)
- Focus on tools that enable complete tasks, not just individual API calls
- Consider what workflows agents actually need to accomplish

**Optimize for Limited Context:**

- Agents have constrained context windows - make every token count
- Return high-signal information, not exhaustive data dumps
- Provide "concise" vs "detailed" response format options
- Default to human-readable identifiers over technical codes (names over IDs)
- Consider the agent's context budget as a scarce resource

**Design Actionable Error Messages:**

- Error messages should guide agents toward correct usage patterns
- Suggest specific next steps: "Try using filter='active_only' to reduce results"
- Make errors educational, not just diagnostic
- Help agents learn proper tool usage through clear feedback

**Follow Natural Task Subdivisions:**

- Tool names should reflect how humans think about tasks
- Group related tools with consistent prefixes for discoverability
- Design tools around natural workflows, not just API structure

**Use Evaluation-Driven Development:**

- Create realistic evaluation scenarios early
- Let agent feedback drive tool improvements
- Prototype quickly and iterate based on actual agent performance

#### 1.2 Study MCP Protocol Documentation

RESOURCE: `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt` PURPOSE: Complete MCP specification and guidelines

RESEARCH TOOL PREFERENCE (in order):

1. **Preferred**: `mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation(query="Model Context Protocol specification")` - High-fidelity verbatim documentation
2. **Alternative**: `mcp__exa__get_code_context_exa(query="MCP protocol server implementation examples")` - Code context and examples
3. **Fallback**: WebFetch - Use only when MCP tools don't provide needed content

RATIONALE: MCP tools provide higher fidelity (verbatim source) compared to WebFetch (AI summaries)

> [Web resource access, definitive guide for getting accurate data for high quality results](./references/accessing_online_resources.md)

#### 1.3 Study Framework Documentation

DECISION_TREE:

```text
IF implementing in Python THEN
  - Load FastMCP patterns from references/development-guidelines.md
  - Load Python SDK documentation from official source
  - Focus on decorator-based patterns and Pydantic validation

ELSE IF implementing in TypeScript/Node THEN
  - Load TypeScript patterns from references/typescript-mcp-server.md
  - Load TypeScript SDK documentation from official source
  - Focus on registerTool patterns and Zod validation

ELSE
  - Load generic best practices from references/mcp-best-practices.md
  - Adapt to target language/framework
```

REFERENCES_IN_SKILL:

- [MCP Best Practices](./references/mcp-best-practices.md) - Universal MCP guidelines
- [FastMCP Development Guidelines](./references/development-guidelines.md) - Python FastMCP specialization
- [TypeScript MCP Server Guide](./references/typescript-mcp-server.md) - TypeScript/Node implementation

- [Example Projects](./references/example-projects.md) - Real-world implementations
- [Evaluation Guide](./references/evaluation-guide.md) - Testing server quality

#### 1.4 Exhaustively Study API Documentation

RULE: The model must read through ALL available API documentation for target service

REQUIREMENTS:

- Official API reference documentation
- Authentication and authorization requirements
- Rate limiting and pagination patterns
- Error responses and status codes
- Available endpoints and their parameters
- Data models and schemas

RESEARCH TOOL HIERARCHY (use in this order):

1. **MCP Ref tool**: `mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation` for official API documentation (verbatim, high-fidelity)
2. **MCP exa tool**: `mcp__exa__get_code_context_exa` for code examples and SDK usage patterns
3. **MCP exa web search**: `mcp__exa__web_search_exa` for general research with LLM-optimized results
4. **Fallback**: WebFetch only when MCP tools don't work

RATIONALE: MCP tools provide superior accuracy, precision, and fidelity for technical documentation

#### 1.5 Create Comprehensive Implementation Plan

PLAN_COMPONENTS:

**Tool Selection:**

- List the most valuable endpoints/operations to implement
- Prioritize tools that enable the most common and important use cases
- Consider which tools work together to enable complex workflows

**Shared Utilities and Helpers:**

- Identify common API request patterns
- Plan pagination helpers
- Design filtering and formatting utilities
- Plan error handling strategies

**Input/Output Design:**

- Define input validation models (Pydantic for Python, Zod for TypeScript)
- Design consistent response formats (JSON and Markdown)
- Design configurable levels of detail (Detailed or Concise)
- Plan for large-scale usage (thousands of users/resources)
- Implement character limits and truncation strategies (e.g., 25,000 tokens)

**Error Handling Strategy:**

- Plan graceful failure modes
- Design clear, actionable, LLM-friendly, natural language error messages
- Consider rate limiting and timeout scenarios
- Handle authentication and authorization errors

### Phase 2: Implementation

RULE: The model must implement following language-specific best practices

#### For Python (FastMCP)

**Python Project Setup:**

RULE: The model must activate the python3-development skill before setting up Python MCP server projects

CONSTRAINT: The python3-development skill contains:

- Python project layouts (src/ vs flat)
- pyproject.toml structure with uv
- Modern Python 3.11+ patterns
- Package structure best practices
- Build/publishing guides
- Lessons learned for successful Python project design

ACTIVATION:

```claude
Skill(command: "python3-development")
```

The model must defer to python3-development for general Python project structure.

**Basic Server Structure:**

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from pydantic import Field
from typing import Annotated

mcp = FastMCP("service_mcp")

@mcp.tool()
def tool_name(
    param: Annotated[str, Field(description="Parameter description")]
) -> dict:
    """Tool description for the AI."""
    return {"result": "value"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()  # Defaults to STDIO transport
```

**Key Patterns:**

- Use `@mcp.tool()` decorator for tools
- Use `Annotated[type, Field(...)]` for parameter validation
- First line of docstring becomes tool description
- Return dict for structured output
- Use `async def` for I/O-bound operations

**See:** [FastMCP Development Guidelines](./references/development-guidelines.md) for complete Python patterns

#### For TypeScript/Node

**Basic Server Structure:**

```typescript
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "service-mcp-server",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

const InputSchema = z
  .object({
    param: z.string().describe("Parameter description"),
  })
  .strict();

server.registerTool(
  "tool_name",
  {
    title: "Tool Title",
    description: "Tool description for the AI",
    inputSchema: InputSchema,
    annotations: { readOnlyHint: true },
  },
  async (params) => {
    return { content: [{ type: "text", text: "result" }] };
  },
);

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

**Key Patterns:**

- Use `registerTool` with complete configuration
- Use Zod schemas with `.strict()`
- Explicitly provide `title`, `description`, `inputSchema`, `annotations`
- Type all parameters and return values

**See:** [TypeScript MCP Server Guide](./references/typescript-mcp-server.md) for complete TypeScript patterns

### Phase 3: Review and Refine

#### 3.1 Code Quality Review

CHECKLIST:

- [ ] DRY Principle: No duplicated code between tools
- [ ] Composability: Shared logic extracted into functions
- [ ] Consistency: Similar operations return similar formats
- [ ] Error Handling: All external calls have error handling
- [ ] Type Safety: Full type coverage (Python type hints, TypeScript types)
- [ ] Documentation: Every tool has comprehensive docstrings/descriptions

#### 3.2 Test and Build

**Important:** MCP servers are long-running processes. Running them directly causes your process to hang indefinitely.

**Safe Testing:**

- Use evaluation harness (see Phase 4)
- Run server in tmux to keep it outside main process
- Use timeout when testing: `timeout 5s python server.py`

**For Python:**

```bash
python -m py_compile your_server.py  # Verify syntax
```

**For TypeScript:**

```bash
npm run build  # Must complete without errors
```

### Phase 4: Create Evaluations

RULE: The model must create comprehensive evaluations to test server effectiveness

RESOURCE: [Evaluation Guide](./references/evaluation-guide.md)

**Purpose:** Evaluations test whether LLMs can effectively use your MCP server to answer realistic, complex questions.

**Process:**

1. **Tool Inspection** - List available tools and understand capabilities
2. **Content Exploration** - Use READ-ONLY operations to explore available data
3. **Question Generation** - Create 10 complex, realistic questions
4. **Answer Verification** - Solve each question yourself to verify answers

**Requirements:** Each question must be:

- Independent (not dependent on other questions)
- Read-only (only non-destructive operations required)
- Complex (requiring multiple tool calls and deep exploration)
- Realistic (based on real use cases humans would care about)
- Verifiable (single, clear answer that can be verified by string comparison)
- Stable (answer won't change over time)

**Output Format:**

```xml
<evaluation>
  <qa_pair>
    <question>Complex question requiring multiple tool calls</question>
    <answer>Single verifiable answer</answer>
  </qa_pair>
</evaluation>
```

**Evaluation Scripts:**

Located in `./scripts/`:

- `evaluation.py` - Evaluation harness
- `connections.py` - MCP connection utilities
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `example_evaluation.xml` - Example evaluation

**Usage:**

```bash
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key

python scripts/evaluation.py \
  -t stdio \
  -c python \
  -a my_mcp_server.py \
  evaluation.xml
```

## Quick Reference

### FastMCP (Python) Quick Start

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from pydantic import Field
from typing import Annotated

mcp = FastMCP("my-server")

@mcp.tool()
def search_items(
    query: str,
    limit: Annotated[int, Field(ge=1, le=100)] = 10
) -> dict:
    """Search for items matching the query."""
    results = perform_search(query, limit)
    return {"results": results, "count": len(results)}

@mcp.resource("data://config")
def get_config() -> dict:
    return {"setting": "value"}

@mcp.prompt()
def explain_topic(topic: str) -> str:
    return f"Explain the concept of '{topic}'"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()  # STDIO transport
    # OR: mcp.run(transport="http", port=8000)
```

### TypeScript/Node Quick Start

```typescript
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "my-server",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

const SearchSchema = z
  .object({
    query: z.string(),
    limit: z.number().int().min(1).max(100).default(10),
  })
  .strict();

server.registerTool(
  "search_items",
  {
    title: "Search Items",
    description: "Search for items matching the query",
    inputSchema: SearchSchema,
    annotations: { readOnlyHint: true },
  },
  async (params) => {
    const results = await performSearch(params.query, params.limit);
    return {
      content: [
        {
          type: "text",
          text: JSON.stringify({ results, count: results.length }, null, 2),
        },
      ],
    };
  },
);

const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```
