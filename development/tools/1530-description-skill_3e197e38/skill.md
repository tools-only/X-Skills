description: This skill provides comprehensive documentation for Hatchling, the modern Python build backend that implements PEP 517/518/621/660 standards. Use this skill when working with Hatchling configuration, build system setup, Python packaging, pyproject.toml configuration, project metadata, dependencies, entry points, build hooks, version management, wheel and sdist builds, package distribution, setuptools migration, and troubleshooting Hatchling build errors.

# Hatchling

## Overview

Hatchling is a modern, standards-compliant Python build backend that replaces legacy setuptools for package building. It provides clear configuration through `pyproject.toml`, intelligent defaults, and extensibility through hooks and plugins. This skill enables understanding Hatchling's architecture, configuration options, and build customization capabilities.

## Key Capabilities

- **Configuration via pyproject.toml**: Standards-compliant PEP 621 metadata with sensible defaults
- **Build Targets**: Wheel and source distribution builds with extensive customization
- **Build Hooks**: Dynamic code execution during build for artifacts, version management, and compilation
- **Version Management**: Multiple version sources with automatic version injection
- **File Selection**: Git-aware VCS integration with glob pattern matching
- **Plugins**: Extensible architecture for custom builders, hooks, and metadata hooks
