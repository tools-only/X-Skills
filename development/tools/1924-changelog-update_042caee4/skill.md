Before committing, have you updated the CHANGELOG.md?

If this commit includes user-facing changes:
- [ ] Added entry under `[Unreleased]` section
- [ ] Used appropriate category: Added, Changed, Fixed, or Removed
- [ ] Described the change from the user's perspective

Skip if this is a trivial change (typo fixes, formatting, internal refactoring).
