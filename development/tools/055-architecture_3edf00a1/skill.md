## Components

### Agents

AI assistants that want to have voice conversations. They connect via MCP (Model Context Protocol) and use tools like `status` and `converse`.

- Connect using `mcp-remote` to `https://voicemode.dev/mcp`
- Authenticate via OAuth
- Call MCP tools to interact with the platform

### Clients

Devices that handle the actual voice I/O (microphone/speaker). They connect via WebSocket.

- iOS app - native mobile client
- Web app - browser-based dashboard at voicemode.dev
- Future: macOS menu bar app, browser extension

### Platform

The voicemode.dev backend routes messages between agents and clients.

- User accounts link agents and clients
- WebSocket connections for real-time voice delivery
- OAuth authentication via Auth0

## Connection Flow

1. **Agent connects**: Claude Code adds the MCP server and authenticates
2. **Client connects**: User opens iOS/web app and signs in with same account
3. **Agent sends message**: Uses `converse` tool with text to speak
4. **Platform routes**: Message delivered to connected client(s)
5. **Client speaks**: TTS plays on device, STT captures response
6. **Response returns**: User's voice response sent back to agent

## Authentication

Both agents and clients authenticate against the same voicemode.dev account:

- **Agents**: OAuth flow triggered when MCP tools are first used
- **Clients**: Standard login flow in app/web

The platform matches agents to clients by user account.

## Protocol Notes

- MCP transport: stdio to mcp-remote, which handles HTTP/SSE
- WebSocket: persistent connection for clients
- Voice data: handled by clients, not transmitted through platform (clients use their own TTS/STT)
