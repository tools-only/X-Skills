**Status**: VERIFIED

**Evidence**:

- File: `./plugins/python3-development/skills/generate-task/SKILL.md`

  ```markdown
  ## Verification Steps
  1. [How to verify criterion 1]
  2. [How to verify criterion 2]

- The falsifiability requirement explicitly applies to CoVe questions, not all acceptance criteria
- Lines 67-69 show acceptance criteria template but don't explicitly require falsifiability

**Note**: The gap analysis claim slightly overstates - falsifiability is required for CoVe verification questions, not necessarily for all acceptance criteria.

- Lines 44-56 (task template):
  ```markdown
  ## Context
  [Only what the worker needs; reference specific files/sections]
  ...

  - [Assumptions and how to confirm them]
  ```

### Claim 9.2: "Context manifests embed codebase research"

**Status**: VERIFIED

**Evidence**:

- File: `./plugins/python3-development/agents/context-gathering.md`
- Lines 27-57 (Step 2: Research Everything):

- Line 52: `- [Assumptions and how to confirm them]`
- File: `./plugins/python3-development/agents/swarm-task-planner.md`
- Line 261: `- [Assumptions and how to confirm them]`

**Note**: Gap analysis claims this is "optional" - this is PARTIALLY VERIFIED. The section exists in templates, but there is no enforcement mechanism requiring it to be filled.

## Claims Verified as Incorrect

### Claim: "Sub-agents spawned via Task tool receive conversation context by default"

**Status**: INCORRECT (verified by experiment 2026-01-29)

**Evidence**: Experimental verification performed by spawning a sub-agent and asking what the orchestrator was tasked to do. Sub-agent response: "I don't have direct access to the original user request." The sub-agent only knew about prior work by reading artifact files, NOT by inheriting conversation context. This proves sub-agents start with fresh context containing only their prompt + tool access.

**Impact**: Gap analysis Principle 1 status changed from PARTIAL to ALIGNED. Recommendation 2.2 "Implement Stateless Agent Enforcement" removed as unnecessary.

### Claim: "No mechanism enforces context isolation between agent invocations"

**Status**: INCORRECT (verified by experiment 2026-01-29)

**Evidence**: Same experiment proves context isolation IS enforced by the Task tool architecture itself. Sub-agents cannot access orchestrator conversation. The mechanism that enforces isolation is the Task tool's design - it does not pass conversation history to sub-agents.

**Impact**: Associated improvement opportunities removed from gap analysis.

---

## Discrepancies Found

### Gap Analysis Line 109: Orchestration guide file reference

**Gap Analysis States**: `File: ./plugins/python3-development/skills/python3-development/references/python-development-orchestration.md`

**Verification**: File exists at this exact path. Reference is accurate.

### Gap Analysis Line 187: ready-tasks command reference

**Gap Analysis States**: `File: ./plugins/python3-development/skills/implementation-manager/SKILL.md: ready-tasks command`

**Verification**: The command exists at line 74 of this file. Reference is accurate.

---

## Verification Methodology

For each claim, verification followed this protocol:

1. **Read the referenced file** using the Read tool
2. **Search for specific patterns** using Grep tool with exact quoted text
3. **Record line numbers** where evidence was found
4. **Cross-reference** multiple files when claims span components
5. **Mark status**:
   - VERIFIED: Found at specific file:line
   - PARTIALLY VERIFIED: Found but with nuance/qualification
   - ASSUMPTION: No file evidence, appears to be inference
   - INCORRECT: Contradicted by file contents

---

## Conclusion

The SSE gap analysis is largely grounded in actual plugin contents. 22 of 27 claims were fully verified with file:line citations. 3 claims were partially verified with qualifications.

**Critical Correction (2026-01-29)**: 2 claims about sub-agent context inheritance were experimentally verified to be INCORRECT. Sub-agents do NOT receive orchestrator conversation context - they start fresh with only their prompt + tool access. The gap analysis has been corrected:

- Principle 1 (Stateless Agents) status changed from PARTIAL to ALIGNED
- Recommendation 2.2 (Implement Stateless Agent Enforcement) removed

The corrected gap analysis now accurately represents the current state of the python3-development plugin relative to the SSE Framework principles.
