## Overview

Prompt Engine is a web-based SaaS platform that converts plain-language descriptions into professionally crafted, optimisation-grade prompts for use with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other LLMs. It exposes three core capabilities—Generate, Optimize, and Organize—enabling users to produce high-quality prompts in under 15 seconds without manual prompt-engineering knowledge. The platform targets both non-technical users who want consistent AI outputs and experienced practitioners who want a faster iteration loop.

## Problem Addressed

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Writing effective prompts takes 15+ minutes and requires deep prompt-engineering expertise | Generate feature transforms a plain-language description into a professional prompt in seconds |
| Existing prompts produce inconsistent or low-quality AI responses | Optimize feature applies advanced prompt-engineering techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought, role assignment) to improve an existing prompt |
| High-value prompts are scattered across chat histories and hard to rediscover | Organize feature stores prompts in a searchable, tagged library with bookmarks |
| First-try prompts rarely get exactly the desired output | Platform targets first-try success so users avoid multiple revision cycles |
| Most users only access a fraction of an LLM's capability | Structured prompts unlock model behaviours that informal chat-style inputs miss |

## Key Features

### Generate

- Accepts a plain-language description of a task and outputs a fully structured, professional-grade prompt
- Targets < 15-second generation time regardless of task complexity
- Compatible prompts are tested against ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini

### Optimize

- Accepts an existing prompt and rewrites it using expert prompt-engineering techniques (role framing, chain-of-thought hints, explicit output format directives, constraint specification)
- Aimed at users who already have a working prompt but want higher consistency and quality

### Organize

- Prompt library with categorisation, tagging, and bookmarking
- History of all previously generated prompts
- Instant retrieval of high-performing prompts without rewriting from scratch

### Subscription & Access

- Monthly subscription at $19/month with 1,000 generation credits
- Priority customer support included
- Account-based prompt history and library persistence

## Technical Architecture

Prompt Engine is a closed-source, Next.js-based web application (evidenced by `/_next/` asset paths). Content is served via a Sanity.io CMS backend (evident from `cdn.sanity.io` image URLs). The platform's core prompt generation and optimization logic is proprietary and not publicly disclosed; outputs are routed to an internal inference pipeline that produces structured prompts returned to the browser client. No SDK or API is publicly available.

## Installation & Usage

Prompt Engine is a web-only SaaS; no installation is required.

```text
1. Visit https://www.promptengine.cc
2. Create an account (free trial or $19/month subscription)
3. Describe your task in plain language in the Generate field
4. Receive a professionally crafted prompt ready to paste into any LLM interface
5. Optionally run the prompt through Optimize to further refine it
6. Save high-performing prompts to the Organize library for future reuse
```

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

### Applications

- **Rapid SKILL.md prototyping**: The Generate feature can bootstrap an initial skill prompt from a brief description, which can then be iteratively refined in Claude Code—reducing cold-start time for new skills
- **Prompt optimization reference**: The Optimize feature demonstrates real-world demand for automated prompt quality improvement; similar logic could be embedded in a `skill-creator` or `prompt-optimizer` Claude Code skill
- **Prompt library UX pattern**: The Organize feature's tag + bookmark model is a practical reference for how a future skill catalogue or prompt registry could be surfaced to Claude Code users

### Patterns Worth Adopting

- **Plain-language to structured prompt pipeline**: The Generate → Review → Optimize loop mirrors how skill authoring could work in Claude Code: describe intent → auto-generate SKILL.md → lint/optimize → commit
- **First-try success as a quality metric**: Targeting first-try output quality (rather than iterative refinement) is a useful framing for skill evaluation harnesses in `evaluation-testing/`
- **Prompt categorisation taxonomy**: Using tags and categories for prompt retrieval maps directly to how skills are organised in the plugin marketplace manifest (`marketplace.json`)

### Integration Opportunities

- A Claude Code `skill-creator` plugin could call the Prompt Engine API (if one becomes available) to generate skill content from a one-line description, paralleling how the current `skill-creator` scaffolds files from templates
- The platform's prompt optimization output format could be reverse-engineered (by comparing input/output pairs) to inform automated quality checks in the `holistic-linting` plugin
- A future `prompt-registry` skill could adopt Prompt Engine's library pattern—storing, tagging, and retrieving reusable prompt fragments across skills

### Competitive Analysis

| Tool | Focus | Key Differentiator |
|------|-------|--------------------|
| Prompt Engine | Generation + Optimization + Library | All-in-one SaaS, no setup, < 15-second output |
| Google AI Studio | Playground + Parameter tuning | Full Gemini model access, code export, free tier |
| PromptHub / Langchain Hub | Prompt versioning and sharing | Community-driven, open prompts, SDK integration |
| Custom SKILL.md authoring | Claude Code–native prompt design | Tightly coupled with agent/skill execution context |
