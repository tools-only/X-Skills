**Agent**: orchestrator

**Target**: `./plugins/python3-development/skills/`
**Issue Type**: STRUCTURE_FIX

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. Five new skill directories created under `./plugins/python3-development/skills/`
2. Directory names match design spec: python3-workflow, python3-typing, python3-cli, python3-quality, python3-project
3. Each directory contains empty placeholder for SKILL.md creation
4. Directory permissions allow file creation by refactoring agents

**Required Inputs**:

- Design spec section: "Skill Splits" → "Proposed Split" table (lines 33-41)
- Existing plugin directory: `./plugins/python3-development/`

**Expected Outputs**:

- `./plugins/python3-development/skills/python3-workflow/` (directory)
- `./plugins/python3-development/skills/python3-typing/` (directory)
- `./plugins/python3-development/skills/python3-cli/` (directory)
- `./plugins/python3-development/skills/python3-quality/` (directory)
- `./plugins/python3-development/skills/python3-project/` (directory)

**Can Parallelize With**: Task 1.2, Task 1.3
**Reason**: Operates on different directories - no file conflicts

**Verification Steps**:

1. Run `ls -la ./plugins/python3-development/skills/` and verify 5 new directories exist
2. Run `ls -la ./plugins/python3-development/skills/python3-workflow/` for each directory - should be empty but accessible
3. Verify directory permissions allow write access

## Context Manifest

**Generated**: 2026-01-23 by context-gathering agent

### How the Current Skill Architecture Works

The python3-development plugin at `./plugins/python3-development/` contains a single monolithic SKILL.md file spanning 1,318 lines that covers five distinct domains: orchestration/workflow patterns, type safety with mypy, CLI development with Typer/Rich, linting/quality workflows, and project structure standards. This monolithic design violates the recommended skill size guideline of 400 lines maximum per skill.

When a user activates the skill via `@python3-development` or `Skill(command: "python3-development")`, Claude Code loads the entire 1,318-line SKILL.md into context. The skill's frontmatter (lines 1-7) defines 10 trigger conditions covering any Python-related work. The description field uses a `<hint>` XML tag to provide additional context about what the skill provides without triggering early activation.

The skill distinguishes between orchestrator and sub-agent roles through `<section ROLE_TYPE="orchestrator">` tags at four locations:

- Lines 713-846: Agent orchestration and pre-delegation protocol
- Lines 924-940: Core workflows overview
- Lines 1227-1246: Common delegation patterns
- Lines 1305-1318: Summary for orchestrators

Sub-agents reading this skill receive all content EXCEPT sections wrapped in `<section ROLE_TYPE="orchestrator">` tags. This allows the same skill to provide different guidance based on the reader's role.

### Domain Content Line Ranges for Skill Split

Based on analysis of SKILL.md content and the design spec, the five new skills will extract content from these specific line ranges:

**python3-workflow (~200 lines target)**

| Section             | Lines     | Description                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Role Identification | 11-35     | Mandatory role echo statement                               |
| Agent Orchestration | 713-846   | Pre-delegation protocol, delegation table, required reading |
| Core Workflows      | 924-940   | TDD, Feature Addition, Refactoring, Debugging, Code Review  |
| Common Patterns     | 1227-1246 | Delegation anti-patterns table                              |

**python3-typing (~350 lines target)**

| Section                          | Lines   | Description                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Type Safety Requirements         | 274-279 | Introduction to typing requirements               |
| When to Use Generics             | 281-364 | TypeVar patterns, bounds, restrictions, Self type |
| When to Use Protocols            | 365-436 | Structural typing, runtime_checkable              |

### Orphaned Files

**planning/reference-document-architecture.md** (65,328 bytes, 1 file):

- Status: `historical-proposal`, `implementation_status: not-implemented`
- Not linked from any active documentation
- Resolution: Move to `./plugins/python3-development/docs/archive/`

### Migration Path Summary

**Phase 1**: Create 5 skill directories + plugin.json + archive orphan

- New directories: python3-workflow, python3-typing, python3-cli, python3-quality, python3-project
- Create plugin.json with skill and command metadata
- Move planning/ to docs/archive/

**Phase 2**: Create 5 new SKILL.md files (parallelizable) + fix 6 command frontmatter files

- Each skill extracts content from line ranges documented above
- Commands get standardized frontmatter with trigger-optimized descriptions

**Phase 3**: Move references/ and assets/ to python3-project, update relative paths

- All 26 reference files move to `./skills/python3-project/references/`
- All asset files move to `./skills/python3-project/assets/`
- Other 4 skills reference via `../python3-project/references/`
- Delete original python3-development/ directory

**Phase 4**: Validation

- Test plugin with `claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/python3-development`
- Test skill loading for all 5 skills
- Verify all cross-references resolve
- Run pre-commit on modified files
- Update README.md

### Technical Reference Details

**Frontmatter schema for new skills**:

```yaml
---
name: python3-{domain}
description: 'Use when: [trigger conditions]. Provides: [capabilities].'
---
```

**Relative path patterns after migration**:

- From python3-workflow to references: `../python3-project/references/python-development-orchestration.md`
- From python3-typing to mypy-docs: `../python3-project/references/mypy-docs/generics.rst`
- From python3-cli to assets: `../python3-project/assets/typer_examples/index.md`

**Symlink recreation command**:

```bash
ln -sf /home/ubuntulinuxqa2/repos/claude_skills/plugins/agent-orchestration/skills/agent-orchestration/references/accessing_online_resources.md \
  ./plugins/python3-development/skills/python3-project/references/accessing_online_resources.md
```

## Dependency Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation (Parallel Execution)

- **Task 1.1** (directories), **Task 1.2** (plugin.json), **Task 1.3** (archive orphan)
- No dependencies between tasks - all can run simultaneously
- **Blocking**: Phase 2 skill creation

### Phase 2A: Skill Creation (Parallel Execution)

- **Task 2.1** (workflow), **Task 2.2** (typing), **Task 2.3** (cli), **Task 2.4** (quality), **Task 2.5** (project)
- All depend on **Task 1.1** only
- No dependencies between tasks - all can run simultaneously
- **Blocking**: Phase 3 migrations

### Phase 2B: Command Fixes (Parallel with Phase 2A)

- **Task 2.6** (fix 6 command frontmatter files)
- No dependencies - can run simultaneously with Phase 2A
- **Blocking**: None (independent work)

### Phase 3: Migration (Sequential with Some Parallelism)

- **Task 3.1** (move references) and **Task 3.2** (move assets) - PARALLEL
- Both depend on Phase 2 completion
- **Task 3.3** (update paths) depends on **Task 3.1** + **Task 3.2**
- **Task 3.4** (delete old) depends on **Task 3.3**
- **Blocking**: Validation phase

### Phase 4: Validation (Mostly Sequential)

- **Task V1** (plugin assessment) depends on all Phase 1-3 tasks
- **Task V2** (docs) depends on **Task V1**
- **Task V3** (plugin testing) depends on **Task V1** - PARALLEL with **Task V2**
- **Task V4** (pre-commit) depends on **Task V1** + **Task V2** - PARALLEL with **Task V3**

### Parallelization Summary

- **Maximum parallel tasks**: 5 (during Phase 2A skill creation) or 6 (if including Phase 2B)
- **Critical path**: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 (minimum 4 sequential stages)
- **Total tasks**: 19
