# Toolbox Talk Generator

## Overview

Automatically generate relevant safety toolbox talks based on daily work activities, weather conditions, recent incidents, and seasonal hazards. Support multiple languages for diverse crews.

## Quick Start

```python
# Initialize generator
generator = ToolboxTalkGenerator()

# Generate contextual daily talk
talk = generator.generate_daily_talk(
    project="Office Tower",
    weather="Hot, 95°F, sunny",
    activities=["concrete pour", "steel erection"],
    recent_incidents=["near miss - unsecured tool dropped"]
)

# Get formatted script
script = generator.format_talk_script(talk)
print(script)

# Record attendance
record = generator.record_talk(
    talk_id=talk.id,
    project="Office Tower",
    location="Level 5 staging area",
    presenter="John Smith",
    attendees=["Worker 1", "Worker 2", "Worker 3"],
    questions=["Where are the water coolers?"],
    follow_ups=["Add water station near grid C"]
)

# Get summary
summary = generator.get_attendance_summary()
print(f"Total talks: {summary['total_talks']}")
print(f"Unique workers trained: {summary['unique_workers']}")
```

## Requirements

```bash
pip install (no external dependencies)
```

## Integration with LLM

```python
def generate_with_llm(topic: str, context: str) -> str:
    """Use LLM to generate custom toolbox talk."""
    prompt = f"""
    Generate a 10-minute toolbox talk for construction workers about: {topic}

    Context: {context}

    Include:
    1. Brief introduction (why this matters)
    2. 4-5 specific hazards
    3. 4-5 control measures
    4. 3 key points to remember
    5. 2-3 discussion questions

    Keep language simple and direct. Workers have varying English levels.
    """

    # Call your LLM API here
    # response = llm.generate(prompt)
    return response
```
