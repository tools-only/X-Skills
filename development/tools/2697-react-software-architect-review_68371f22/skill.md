## Architectural Patterns Reference

### Recommended Component Structure
```typescript
// Feature-based organization
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/                    # Primitive/design system components
│   │   ├── Button/
│   │   │   ├── Button.tsx
│   │   │   ├── Button.test.tsx
│   │   │   └── index.ts
│   │   └── Card/
│   ├── layout/                # Layout components
│   │   ├── Header/
│   │   ├── Sidebar/
│   │   └── Footer/
│   └── common/                # Shared feature components
├── features/                  # Feature modules
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── api/
│   │   ├── types/
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── dashboard/
├── hooks/                     # Shared custom hooks
├── lib/                       # Utilities and helpers
├── types/                     # Shared TypeScript types
└── stores/                    # Global state stores
```

### State Management Decision Matrix
```
Local UI State → useState/useReducer
Server State → TanStack Query/SWR
Form State → React Hook Form
URL State → Router (Next.js/Remix)
Cross-Component → Context (limited scope)
Global App State → Zustand/Jotai (minimal)
Complex Domain → Redux Toolkit (rare)
```

### Performance Optimization Hierarchy
```
1. Proper component composition (avoid unnecessary re-renders)
2. State colocation (keep state close to usage)
3. Code splitting (route-based, then component-based)
4. React.memo (only when measured benefit)
5. useMemo/useCallback (sparingly, with measurement)
6. Virtualization (for long lists)
7. Lazy loading (for heavy components)
```

## Best Practices
- **Component-First Approach**: Focus on proper component boundaries and composition
- **State Colocation**: Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- **Performance by Design**: Build performant patterns from the start, not as afterthought
- **Accessibility First**: Consider accessibility in component API design from the beginning
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for component props, state, and API contracts
- **Testable Design**: Ensure components are easily testable with proper isolation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build for baseline functionality with enhanced experiences
- **Documentation**: Maintain Storybook stories and component documentation

- Assessment of current architecture quality (1-10 scale)
- Component hierarchy and composition evaluation
- State management strategy assessment
- Performance implications and optimization opportunities
- Accessibility compliance status
- Concrete refactoring recommendations with code examples
- Risk assessment of proposed changes
