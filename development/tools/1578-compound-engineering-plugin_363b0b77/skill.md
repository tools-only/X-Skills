## Overview

The Compound Engineering Plugin is a Claude Code plugin marketplace featuring a comprehensive collection of AI agents, commands, and skills designed to make each unit of engineering work easier than the last. Developed by Every Inc., it implements a "compounding engineering" philosophy where planning and review comprise 80% of the workflow, with execution at 20%.

**Core Value Proposition**: Invert the traditional development cycle where features accumulate technical debt. Instead, each development cycle documents learnings, improves patterns, and makes future work easier.

## Problem Addressed

| Problem                                                             | How Compound Engineering Solves It                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Development work accumulates technical debt over time               | Compounding cycle documents solutions and patterns for reuse                            |
| Code reviews catch issues too late in the development cycle         | 14 specialized review agents run in parallel before code is merged                      |
| Knowledge silos form when only one developer knows a solution       | `/workflows:compound` command captures solutions in searchable `docs/solutions/`        |
| Planning is often rushed, leading to rework                         | `/workflows:plan` includes research decision logic and Q&A refinement                   |
| Inconsistent code review quality across team members                | Multi-agent review with domain specialists (security, performance, architecture)        |
| Context loss when switching between tasks                           | Git worktree integration for parallel development without context switching             |
| External framework documentation changes faster than team knowledge | Context7 MCP server provides real-time framework documentation lookup (100+ frameworks) |

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

### Direct Applications

1. **Plugin Architecture Reference**: The plugin structure (agents/, commands/, skills/, mcp-servers/) demonstrates best practices for Claude Code plugin development
2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: The parallel agent execution pattern in `/workflows:review` shows effective orchestration strategies
3. **Knowledge Management**: The `docs/solutions/` pattern with YAML frontmatter provides a reusable knowledge base architecture
4. **Cross-Platform Conversion**: The CLI tool for converting plugins to OpenCode/Codex demonstrates portable skill formats

### Patterns Worth Adopting

1. **80/20 Planning-Execution Split**: Heavy investment in planning and review, minimal execution time
2. **Parallel Agent Execution**: Run 14 review agents simultaneously for comprehensive coverage
3. **Smart Research Decision Logic**: Context-aware research triggering based on risk and familiarity
4. **Compound Documentation**: Structured `docs/solutions/` with YAML frontmatter for searchability
5. **Worktree Integration**: Git worktrees for parallel development without context switching
6. **Category-Based Agent Organization**: Agents grouped by domain (Review, Research, Design, Workflow, Docs)
7. **Interactive Q&A Refinement**: Iterative clarification before plan generation

### Integration Opportunities

1. **Agent Patterns**: Review and research agent implementations could inform custom agent development
2. **Skill Templates**: The `create-agent-skills` and `skill-creator` skills provide guidance for skill authoring
3. **MCP Server Model**: Context7 integration demonstrates MCP server bundling in plugins
4. **Documentation Patterns**: The `compound-docs` skill shows structured knowledge capture
5. **Workflow Commands**: The `workflows:` namespace pattern avoids collisions with built-in commands
