## Discussion

The Kimi K2.5 AI system operates as a containerized platform built on Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm), comprising approximately 56,172 files across the full operating system distribution. At its core, the platform provides two primary interface paradigms: Base KIMI Chat and OK Computer Agents. Both environments share identical underlying infrastructure while differing significantly in their capability frameworks. This document presents a unified technical reference describing the complete system architecture, filesystem structure, comparative capabilities, and operational characteristics.

The system functions as a four-layer containerized architecture isolated at the network level, with a FastAPI control plane managing an IPython compute engine, Playwright-based web automation tools, and structured user workspaces. The total application footprint within the `/app/` directory contains approximately 26,211 files, with the skills framework contributing roughly 745 files excluding dependencies.

## System Architecture

The Kimi K2.5 platform employs a consistent containerized architecture across all operational modes. The container runs isolated from external network connectivity while maintaining internal service communication through localhost interfaces.

```

The architecture organizes into four primary layers. Layer One consists of the control plane implemented in `kernel_server.py`, a FastAPI service running on uvicorn at port 8888. This 10,030 byte Python module exposes endpoints for health checks at `/health`, kernel reset at `/kernel/reset`, status queries at `/kernel/status`, execution interrupt at `/kernel/interrupt`, and connection parameters at `/kernel/connection`. The control plane manages process lifecycle and kernel orchestration, depending on FastAPI, uvicorn, pydantic, and the local jupyter_kernel module.

Layer Two contains the compute engine implemented in `jupyter_kernel.py`, a 17,982 byte module providing IPython kernel management. The kernel spawns as a separate process typically in the PID 300-400 range, executing Python code via ZeroMQ sockets on ephemeral ports with JSON communication over WebSocket. The class structure defines an `ExecutionResult` container and a `JupyterKernel` class with methods for starting kernels, executing code, resetting kernels, and retrieving connection information. The compute environment provides PyTorch 2.8.0 with CUDA 12.8 support, SQLite, NumPy, and standard Python libraries.

Layer Three implements web tools through `browser_guard.py`, a 41,635 byte Playwright-based automation framework controlling Chromium 120.x with custom user-agent construction. Capabilities include automated web search, page content extraction, PDF generation through Chrome print-to-PDF functionality, and session persistence in `/app/data/chrome_data/`. The PDF generation system incorporates a 387-file Chrome extension located at `/app/pdf-viewer/` providing viewer functionality through content scripts, background handlers, and a complete UI implementation with character maps for CJK support and standard PDF fonts.

Layer Four comprises the user workspace at `/mnt/kimi/` with subdirectories for uploads at `/mnt/kimi/upload/` mounted read-only for session-scoped user files, outputs at `/mnt/kimi/output/` as a writable directory for deliverables and chart outputs, and persistent storage at `/mnt/kimi/.store/` for append-only session state including the `citation.jsonl` search cache. An additional workspace at `/mnt/okcomputer/` provides the agent-specific directories including `.store/` for persistent storage, `output/` for user deliverables, and `upload/` for user file ingestion.

## Operating Modes

Kimi K2.5 operates across multiple interface paradigms with varying capability sets. The Base KIMI Chat environment at kimi.com/chat provides a direct conversational interface with a 10-step tool budget per turn, offering K2.5 Instant for fast non-thinking responses and K2.5 Thinking for step-by-step reasoning with visible reasoning tokens. The OK Computer Agent environment at kimi.com/agent extends this foundation with a skill-guided agent framework enabling document generation, React web application building, and structured workflow execution through SKILL.md specifications.

Specialized agent variants include KIMI Docs at kimi.com/docs for document processing with document mode activation, KIMI Sheets at kimi.com/sheets for spreadsheet operations with xlsx skill instructions, KIMI Websites at kimi.com/websites for web application development with webapp skill direction, and KIMI Slides at kimi.com/slides using a specialized prompt distinct from other agents. The K2.5 Agent Swarm in beta provides parallel multi-agent execution for complex research and coding tasks.

Base KIMI Chat and OK Computer share identical infrastructure components. Both environments contain the same `kernel_server.py` control plane, `jupyter_kernel.py` compute engine, `browser_guard.py` web automation, Chrome runtime data comprising approximately 272 files in `/app/data/chrome_data/`, the PDF viewer extension with 387 files, the 57.4 megabyte tectonic LaTeX engine, and the `/mnt/kimi` workspace structure. The key differentiator lies in the skills framework present only in OK Computer.

The Base Chat environment lacks the `/app/.kimi/skills/` directory entirely, meaning it has no guided document generation workflows, no built-in templates for document creation, no structured skill invocation mechanism, and requires manual tool usage for all complex tasks. Users can still perform web searches, execute Python and PyTorch code, use SQLite databases, generate charts with matplotlib, write files to output directories, build React applications manually, create documents through raw Python libraries, and generate PDFs through manual LaTeX workflows, but without the production-grade frameworks, validation pipelines, and pre-configured templates available in OK Computer.

## File System Structure

The root filesystem follows standard Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard organization. The root directory contains essential system directories including `/app/` for the Kimi Agent application files, `/bin/` for essential user binaries, `/boot/` for bootloader files, `/dev/` for device files, `/etc/` for system configuration, `/home/` for user home directories, `/lib/` with variants for 32-bit, 64-bit, and x32 ABI shared libraries, `/media/` and `/mnt/` for mount points, `/opt/` for optional software, `/proc/` as a virtual filesystem for process information, `/root/` for the root user home, `/run/` for runtime variable data, `/sbin/` for essential system binaries, `/srv/` for service data, `/sys/` for system information, `/tmp/` for temporary files, `/usr/` for user utilities and applications, and `/var/` for variable data.

**Note:** Standard Linux system directories `/dev/`, `/proc/`, and `/var/` documentation has been trimmed from this reference. These are standard kernel-managed filesystems present in all Linux systems. Focus on the directories specific to Kimi: `/app/`, `/mnt/kimi/`, and `/mnt/okcomputer/`.

---

The mount points at `/mnt/` provide workspace directories. The `/mnt/kimi/` path contains Kimi platform storage with `.store/` for persistent data including `.current_page.txt` as a 40-byte UI page tracker and `.todo.jsonl` as a 634-byte todo list store.

```text
/mnt/
├── kimi/                         # Kimi platform storage
│   └── .store/                   # Persistent storage directory
│       ├── .current_page.txt     # Current UI page tracker (40 bytes)
│       └── .todo.jsonl          # Todo list storage (634 bytes)
│
└── okcomputer/                   # Agent workspace
    ├── .store/                   # Agent persistent storage
    ├── output/                   # User output directory
    └── upload/                   # User upload directory
        └── [user uploaded files]
```

The `/mnt/okcomputer/` path provides the agent workspace with `.store/` for persistent storage, `output/` for user deliverables, and `upload/` for user file ingestion.

## Security and Isolation

The container implements network isolation at the container level, affecting all processes equally. External connectivity is denied for Python requests, Node.js HTTPS operations, Chrome navigation, and curl or wget operations. Internal localhost communication remains permitted including port 8888 for the kernel server API exposed publicly without authentication, port 9222 for Chrome DevTools Protocol restricted to localhost, port 9223 for Chrome DevTools Protocol exposed publicly, and IPC sockets in `/tmp/tmp*.json` using ZeroMQ.

Filesystem isolation restricts access patterns with read-only mounts at `/mnt/kimi/upload/` for user files, read-write access at `/mnt/kimi/output/` for deliverables, append-only access at `/mnt/kimi/.store/` for session state, and no access to `/root`, `/home/*`, or `/var/log`. Process isolation uses PID namespaces, non-root user execution with limited `/proc` access, and dropped capabilities removing ptrace and mount privileges.

The step counter mechanism enforces a budget of 10 tool calls per user message, tracked per conversation rather than per kernel with persistence across kernel restarts. Counter resets occur only on new user messages, enabling unlimited multi-turn interactions through chaining where 10 steps multiplied by N turns provides 10N effective steps.

## Key Binaries and Components

The system includes several significant binary components. The `KimiXlsx` processor resides at `/app/.kimi/skills/xlsx/scripts/` as a 77 megabyte binary built on .NET 8.0 providing Excel validation and processing capabilities. The `tectonic` LaTeX engine at `/app/` occupies 57 megabytes for document compilation. The DOCX validator at `/app/.kimi/skills/docx/validator/` comprises a 73 kilobyte executable with 50 kilobytes of DLL dependencies for OpenXML validation. The `browser_guard.py` automation framework at `/app/` contains 41 kilobytes of Playwright-based browser control. The `jupyter_kernel.py` integration module at `/app/` spans 17 kilobytes for IPython kernel management. The `kernel_server.py` control plane at `/app/` occupies 10 kilobytes for FastAPI service management.

File counts across the system include approximately 26,211 files in `/app/` including skill modules, over 150 essential binaries in `/bin/`, 18 device files in `/dev/`, 553 configuration files in `/etc/`, over 2,000 shared libraries in `/lib/`, over 50 files across mount points in `/mnt/`, virtual files in `/proc/`, over 25,000 user utilities in `/usr/`, and over 2,000 variable data files in `/var/`.

## The Architecture in Brief

Kimi separates connectivity (what the agent can touch) from cognition (what the agent knows). The tools are generic: shell access, file I/O, and Python execution. The knowledge is dynamic, loaded at runtime from skill files.

```

When you ask for a spreadsheet, the system forces the agent to read `/app/.kimi/skills/xlsx/SKILL.md` before starting. This 925-line file teaches Excel compatibility rules, styling conventions, and validation procedures. After reading it, the generic shell becomes an Excel specialist.

New capabilities are a documentation problem rather than a backend development problem. Write a thorough enough manual, put it in the right directory, and the agent learns a new skill.

## Architecture Notes

The DOCX skill implements a dual-stack architecture separating creation and editing concerns. Creation uses C# with the OpenXML SDK through templates like `Example.cs` and `CJKExample.cs`. Editing uses Python with lxml through the `docx_lib/editing/` subsystem. Validation occurs through a multi-stage pipeline checking element ordering, OpenXML compliance, and business rules.

The XLSX skill centers on validation with the 77 megabyte `KimiXlsx` binary CLI tool providing commands for rechecking, reference validation, inspection, pivot operations, chart verification, and general validation.

The PDF skill offers multi-route generation through HTML with Playwright and Paged.js via `html_to_pdf.js`, LaTeX with the Tectonic compiler via `compile_latex.py`, and process operations with pikepdf and pdfplumber via `pdf.py`.

The WebApp skill provides a single-stack React 18+ environment with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and over 50 pre-installed shadcn/ui components. Project initialization occurs through `init-webapp.sh` creating projects at `/mnt/okcomputer/output/app/`.
