## 📍 Integration Decision

### Action: **Integrate**

**Justification**:
1. **First official MCP extension** → Significant protocol evolution
2. **Co-authored by ecosystem leaders** → Authoritative source
3. **Guide documents MCP extensively** → Incomplete without Apps coverage
4. **Indirect CLI relevance** → Ecosystem understanding, hybrid workflows, MCP server dev

### Where Documented

| File | Section | Lines |
|------|---------|-------|
| `guide/architecture.md` | 6. MCP Integration → MCP Extensions: Apps (SEP-1865) | 656-806 (~150 lines) |
| `guide/ultimate-guide.md` | 8.1 What is MCP → MCP Evolution: Apps Extension | 6509-6599 (~90 lines) |
| `guide/ultimate-guide.md` | 8.5 Plugin System → Table update | 7522-7525 (1 line + note) |
| `machine-readable/reference.yaml` | deep_dive section | 8 new entries |

**Total documentation**: ~240 lines across 3 files

## 🔥 Technical Review Challenge

**Conducted by**: technical-writer agent

**Key findings**:
- ✅ Score justified (4/5 appropriate for ecosystem impact)
- ✅ Documentation structure coherent (architecture + user context)
- ✅ CLI relevance correctly assessed (indirect but significant)
- ⚠️ Initial evaluation underestimated ecosystem importance
- ⚠️ Focus on "direct CLI usage" was too narrow

**Score adjustment**: 2/5 (initial) → 4/5 (revised after challenge)
