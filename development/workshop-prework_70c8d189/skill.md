---

## Step 12: Configure Your Shell Environment

Add environment variables to your shell configuration file.

**For macOS (zsh):**
```bash
echo 'export BK_HOME="$HOME/projects/claude-skills"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

**For Linux/WSL (bash):**
```bash
echo 'export BK_HOME="$HOME/projects/claude-skills"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Now reload your shell configuration:

**For macOS:**
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

**For Linux/WSL:**
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

!!! tip "Verification"
    ```bash
    echo $BK_HOME
    ```
    Should display `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/projects/claude-skills` or `/home/YOUR_USERNAME/projects/claude-skills`.

---

## Step 13: Install the Book-Building Scripts

```bash
cd ~/projects/claude-skills
./scripts/bk-install-scripts
```

!!! tip "Verification"
    ```bash
    which bk
    ```
    Should display a path like `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.local/bin/bk`.

---

## Step 14: Install the Claude Skills

---

## Step 15: Install MkDocs

This installs MkDocs and the Material theme using Conda:

```bash
bk-install-mkdocs
```

!!! note "This May Take Several Minutes"
    The script creates a Conda environment and installs all required Python packages.

!!! tip "Verification"
    ```bash
    conda activate mkdocs
    mkdocs --version
    ```
    Should display something like `mkdocs, version 1.x.x`.

---

## Step 16: Initialize Your Book

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-intelligent-book
mkdocs new .
```

This creates the basic MkDocs structure with:

- `mkdocs.yml` - Configuration file
- `docs/index.md` - Your homepage

!!! tip "Verification"
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
    You should see `mkdocs.yml` and a `docs` directory.

---

## Step 17: Commit and Push Your Changes

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Initial MkDocs setup"
git push
```

!!! tip "Verification"
    Go to your repository on GitHub. You should see the `mkdocs.yml` file and `docs` folder.

---

## Step 18: Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

This builds your site and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

!!! warning "First Deployment"
    The first deployment may take a few minutes. You may also need to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:

    1. Go to your repository on GitHub
    2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
    3. Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**
    4. Select the **gh-pages** branch
    5. Click **Save**
