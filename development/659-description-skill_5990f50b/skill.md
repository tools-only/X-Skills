# Research Curator - Add Resources to Research Directory

Add novel tools, repositories, and resources to `./research/` for future reference in Claude Code development.

---

## Definition of Success

1. A comprehensive research entry exists at `./research/{category}/{resource-name}.md`
2. The entry follows the standard format (see existing entries for reference)
3. `./research/README.md` is updated with the new entry in the appropriate table
4. All information is verified from primary sources with access dates
5. Freshness tracking section is complete
