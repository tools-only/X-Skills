## Overview

This repository is the most comprehensive publicly available collection of leaked and reverse-engineered system prompts, internal tool definitions, and AI model configurations for major commercial AI coding assistants and productivity tools. Maintained by x1xhlol (NotLucknite), it covers 30,000+ lines of system prompt content spanning tools such as Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Devin AI, Copilot, Replit, Lovable, Manus, Perplexity, v0, and many others. The repository serves as a primary reference for understanding how production AI systems structure their instructions, tool schemas, and behavioral constraints.

## Problem Addressed

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| System prompts for major AI tools are proprietary and undocumented | Aggregates leaked and reverse-engineered prompts across 30+ AI tools in one repository |
| Prompt engineers and researchers have no reference for how production AI systems are structured | Provides full verbatim system prompts with internal tool definitions and model configuration details |
| Understanding competitor or peer AI tool architectures requires expensive reverse engineering | Community-maintained collection removes individual reverse-engineering burden |
| No canonical source exists for tracking how AI tool prompts evolve over time | Repository is actively updated with new tools and prompt revisions (latest update: 2026-02-17) |
| Developing high-quality AI coding agents requires understanding existing design patterns | Real-world prompt examples from production systems expose best-practice patterns for tool use, safety rails, and task decomposition |

## Technical Architecture

### Repository Structure

```text
system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools/
  {tool-name}/              # One directory per AI tool
    system-prompt.md        # Full system prompt content
    tools.md                # Internal tool definitions (if available)
    model-info.md           # Model configuration details (if available)
  README.md                 # Index with tool list and support information
```

### Content Sourcing

Content is gathered through:

1. **Prompt injection / extraction**: Techniques that cause models to reveal their system instructions
2. **API inspection**: Intercepting network traffic between AI tool frontends and their backends
3. **Community contributions**: Submissions from researchers and developers who discover prompt content
4. **Open-sourced disclosures**: Some tools (e.g., Cursor, GitHub Copilot) have partially disclosed prompt content

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

### Applications

- **Claude Code system prompt analysis**: The repository includes Claude Code's system prompt, providing direct insight into how Anthropic structures Claude's coding agent instructions — valuable for understanding what behaviors are built-in vs. what can be customized
- **Skill and agent design benchmarking**: Compare Claude Code skill/agent designs against how Cursor, Windsurf, and Devin AI structure their agent instructions to identify gaps and patterns worth adopting
- **Tool schema reference**: The internal tool definitions (JSON function schemas) from production agents like Devin AI and Manus provide real-world examples of tool design for complex coding workflows
- **Safety and refusal pattern research**: Examining safety constraints across multiple AI systems helps design more robust behavioral guardrails for custom Claude Code agents

### Patterns Worth Adopting

- **Explicit tool use protocols**: Most production system prompts include explicit instructions for when and how to use each tool, including ordering preferences and fallback behaviors — a pattern that could strengthen Claude Code skill SKILL.md files
- **Structured task decomposition**: Systems like Devin AI and Manus use layered decomposition instructions (high-level goal → sub-tasks → individual tool calls) that could inform multi-agent orchestration patterns
- **Verbosity and format controls**: Production prompts carefully specify output format, verbosity levels, and when to ask for clarification vs. proceeding autonomously — directly applicable to Claude Code agent design

### Integration Opportunities

- **Prompt pattern library**: Extract and catalog recurring patterns from across the collection (e.g., "how 10 coding agents handle file editing") to inform Claude Code skill content
- **Competitive gap analysis**: Systematically compare Claude Code's available capabilities against those documented for Cursor, Windsurf, and Devin AI to identify missing skill/agent coverage
- **Safety pattern adoption**: Use documented safety and boundary patterns from multiple production systems to improve Claude Code agent behavioral constraints
