# Navigator: Finish What You Start

Sessions that last. AI that learns. Features that ship.

## Why This Exists

**The problem**: AI coding sessions crash at exchange 5-7. Context window fills with documentation you never use.

**Navigator's solution**: Context engineering—load what you need, when you need it. 150k → 12k tokens (92% reduction).

**Result**: Sessions go 20+ exchanges. Features actually ship.

**Proven**: OpenTelemetry-verified, not estimates. Session efficiency scores 94/100.

**NEW in v5.0.0**: Theory of Mind integration based on Riedl & Weidmann 2025 research - bilateral modeling, quality detection, and ToM verification checkpoints.

**NEW in v5.1.0**: Loop Mode with structured completion signals, dual-condition exit gates, and stagnation detection - inspired by Ralph's autonomous loop framework.

**NEW in v5.4.0**: Code Simplification - automatic code clarity improvements before commit. Based on Anthropic's internal code-simplifier pattern. Clarity over brevity, functionality preserved absolutely.

**NEW in v5.5.0**: Auto-Update on Session Start - automatically updates Navigator when newer version detected. No manual `nav-upgrade` needed for daily releases.

**NEW in v5.6.0**: Task Mode - unified workflow orchestration that coordinates between skills, loop mode, and direct execution. Auto-detects complexity and defers to appropriate handler.

**NEW in v5.7.0**: Feature Management - view and toggle Navigator features via `nav-features` skill. Shows feature table on first session after install/update.

**NEW in v5.8.0**: Auto-Update Project Sync - auto-update now syncs project config after plugin update. Version drift detection warns when project config is behind. Restart prompt after mid-session updates.

**NEW in v5.9.0**: Workflow Enforcement - mandatory WORKFLOW CHECK block before task responses. Loop Mode and Task Mode triggers auto-detected. Complexity scoring. Hook-based enforcement available.

**NEW in v6.0.0**: Project Knowledge Graph - unified search across tasks, SOPs, system docs, and experiential memories. Patterns, pitfalls, decisions, and learnings persist across sessions. Query with "What do we know about X?". Auto-surfaces relevant memories on session start.

**NEW in v6.1.0**: Multi-Agent Production - parallel Claude agents with visual dashboard. Natural language trigger: "Run multi-agent workflow for TASK-XX". Role templates (orchestrator, implementer, tester, reviewer, documenter) with minimal context (~5k each). Real-time terminal dashboard shows progress. 3x faster than sequential.

---

## How You'll Use It

**Every session starts with**:
```
"Start my Navigator session"
```

This loads:
- Navigator index (2k tokens) - what exists
- Current task context (3k tokens) - what you're working on
- Nothing else (yet)

**As you work**:
- Need system architecture? Loads on-demand (5k)
- Need SOP? Loads when relevant (2k)
- Need integration details? Loads if required

**Result**: Context window stays efficient. Sessions last 20+ exchanges without restart.

---

## Understanding Context Efficiency

**New to this approach?** Read the philosophy:
- `.agent/philosophy/CONTEXT-EFFICIENCY.md` - Why Navigator exists
- `.agent/philosophy/ANTI-PATTERNS.md` - Common mistakes (upfront loading, etc.)
- `.agent/philosophy/PATTERNS.md` - What works and why

**Quick start?** Continue to [Navigator Workflow](#navigator-workflow-critical---enforce-strictly)

---

## Core Principle

**Context engineering beats bulk loading.**

Not "load everything just in case."
Not "better safe than sorry."

Strategic loading saves 92% of context for actual work.

---

## Navigator Workflow (CRITICAL - ENFORCE STRICTLY)

### WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT (MANDATORY - READ FIRST)

**Before responding to ANY task request, you MUST show this block:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ WORKFLOW CHECK                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Loop trigger: [YES/NO]              │
│ Complexity: [0.X]                   │
│ Mode: [LOOP/TASK/DIRECT]            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Loop Mode triggers** (if ANY match → Mode: LOOP):
- "run until done", "do all", "keep going", "iterate until"
- "finish this", "complete everything", "don't stop"

**Task Mode triggers** (if complexity >= 0.5 → Mode: TASK):
- Multi-file changes, refactoring, new features
- Planning required, architecture changes
- "implement", "refactor", "add feature", "fix all"

**Direct execution** (if neither → Mode: DIRECT):
- Single file edit, quick fix, simple question
- Complexity < 0.5, no loop trigger

**If you skip this check, you are violating Navigator workflow.**

### SESSION START PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**🚨 EVERY new conversation/session MUST begin with**:

```
"Start my Navigator session"
```
OR (legacy): `/nav:start`

**What this does**:
1. Checks for Navigator updates (auto-updates if enabled)
2. Loads `.agent/DEVELOPMENT-README.md` (navigator)
3. Loads user profile for bilateral modeling (if exists)
4. Checks for assigned tasks from PM tool (if configured)
5. Sets Navigator workflow context
6. Activates token optimization strategy
7. Applies ToM preferences from profile

**If user doesn't start session**:
- You MUST proactively suggest it
- Never proceed without loading navigator
- This is NOT optional - it's the foundation of Navigator

---

### Documentation Loading Strategy

**1. Read Navigator First** (Always)

After starting session, `.agent/DEVELOPMENT-README.md` provides:
- Documentation index
- "When to read what" decision tree
- Current task context
- Integration setup status

**2. Lazy-Load Based on Task**

**Never load all docs at once** - defeats Navigator's purpose.

Examples:
- **Implementing feature**: DEVELOPMENT-README (2k) + task doc (3k) + system doc (5k) = 10k tokens
- **Debugging**: DEVELOPMENT-README (2k) + SOP (2k) + system doc if needed (5k) = 9k tokens
- **Integration**: DEVELOPMENT-README (2k) + integration SOP (2k) + architecture (5k) = 9k tokens

**vs 150k tokens loading everything**

**3. Update Documentation As You Go**

- After feature: "Archive TASK-XX documentation"
- After solving issue: "Create an SOP for debugging [issue]"
- After architecture change: "Update system architecture documentation"

---

### Autonomous Task Completion (CRITICAL)

**When task implementation is complete, execute finish protocol AUTOMATICALLY**:

✅ **DO automatically** (no human prompt needed):
1. **Simplify code** (if enabled and code modified) - clarity improvements
2. Commit changes with conventional commit message
3. Archive implementation plan
4. Close ticket in PM tool (if configured)
5. Create completion marker
6. Suggest compact to clear context

❌ **DON'T wait for**: "Please commit", "Close ticket", "Update docs"

**Exception cases** (ask first):
- Secrets in uncommitted files
- Multiple unrelated tasks modified
- Tests failing or implementation incomplete

**Key principle**: Navigator expects full autonomy. Execute finish protocol without prompts.

---

### Theory of Mind Integration (v5.0.0)

Navigator v5.0.0 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) principles from Riedl & Weidmann 2025 research.

**Core insight**: ToM predicts collaborative ability (23-29% boost) but NOT solo ability. Users who better model Claude's capabilities achieve better outcomes.

#### ToM Features

**1. Verification Checkpoints** (high-stakes skills)
- backend-endpoint, frontend-component, nav-task, database-migration
- Show understanding before generating code
- Skip for simple operations (high-stakes only mode)

**2. Bilateral Modeling** (nav-profile skill)
- Claude learns YOUR preferences across sessions
- Auto-learns from corrections
- Adapts communication style, frameworks, verbosity
- "Remember I prefer concise explanations"

**3. Quality Detection** (nav-diagnose skill)
- Detects when collaboration quality drops
- Auto-triggers after repeated corrections
- Prompts re-anchoring to restore alignment
- "Something seems off" → diagnose and re-anchor

**4. Enhanced Markers** (nav-marker)
- Captures user intent and goals (not just state)
- Records corrections made during session
- Preserves belief state for accurate restoration

**5. Belief State Anchors** (optional)
- Explicit assumption declarations before generation
- Known/assumed/unknown categorization
- Enable with `tom_features.belief_anchors: true`

#### ToM Configuration

In `.agent/.nav-config.json`:
```json
{
  "tom_features": {
    "verification_checkpoints": true,
    "confirmation_threshold": "high-stakes",
    "profile_enabled": true,
    "diagnose_enabled": true,
    "belief_anchors": false
  }
}
```

---

### Loop Mode (v5.1.0)

Navigator v5.1.0 introduces **Loop Mode** - structured completion with "run until done" capability inspired by Ralph's autonomous loop framework.

#### What Loop Mode Does

- **NAVIGATOR_STATUS block**: Structured completion signals each iteration
- **Dual-condition exit gate**: Requires both heuristics (2+ indicators) AND explicit EXIT_SIGNAL
- **Stagnation detection**: Circuit breaker pauses after 3 same-state iterations
- **Progress phases**: INIT → RESEARCH → IMPL → VERIFY → COMPLETE

#### Enabling Loop Mode

**Natural language triggers**:
```
"Run until done: add user authentication"
"Keep going until complete"
"Iterate until finished"
"Loop mode for this task"
```

**Configuration** (`.agent/.nav-config.json`):
```json
{
  "loop_mode": {
    "enabled": false,
    "max_iterations": 5,
    "stagnation_threshold": 3,
    "exit_requires_explicit_signal": true
  }
}
```

#### NAVIGATOR_STATUS Block

Each iteration shows:
```
NAVIGATOR_STATUS
==================================================
Phase: VERIFY
Iteration: 3/5
Progress: 75%

Completion Indicators:
  [x] Code committed
  [x] Tests passing
  [ ] Documentation updated
  [ ] Ticket closed

Exit Conditions:
  Heuristics: 2/4 (need 2+)
  EXIT_SIGNAL: false

State Hash: a7b3c9
Stagnation: 1/3
==================================================
```

#### Exit Signal

Loop mode requires explicit completion signal alongside heuristics:

```
I've completed the implementation. All requirements met.

EXIT_SIGNAL: true
```

This prevents premature exits when indicators are met but work remains.

#### Integration with Navigator

- **nav-diagnose**: Stagnation triggers quality check
- **nav-marker**: Markers capture loop state for resumption
- **nav-simplify**: Code simplified during VERIFY phase (v5.4.0+)
- **Autonomous completion**: EXIT_SIGNAL triggers the autonomous protocol

---

### Code Simplification (v5.4.0)

Navigator v5.4.0 introduces **Code Simplification** - automatic code clarity improvements before commit, based on Anthropic's internal code-simplifier pattern.

#### Core Principle

**Clarity over brevity. Functionality preserved absolutely.**

Never change what code does - only how it does it.

#### Simplification Rules

1. **Preserve Functionality**: All original features, outputs, behaviors intact
2. **Enhance Clarity**:
   - Flatten nested ternaries to if-else/switch
   - Extract deeply nested code to helper functions
   - Use early returns to reduce nesting
   - Rename unclear variables to descriptive names
   - Remove redundant boolean comparisons
3. **Apply Project Standards**: Follow patterns defined in this file
4. **Maintain Balance**: Don't over-simplify or create "clever" solutions

#### When Simplification Runs

- **Autonomous completion**: After verify, before commit (if enabled)
- **Loop Mode**: During VERIFY phase as completion indicator
- **Multi-Claude**: Dedicated "simplifier" role in parallel workflows
- **On-demand**: "simplify this code", "review for clarity"

#### Configuration

In `.agent/.nav-config.json`:
```json
{
  "simplification": {
    "enabled": true,
    "trigger": "post-implementation",
    "scope": "modified",
    "model": "opus",
    "skip_patterns": ["*.test.*", "*.spec.*", "*.md"],
    "auto_apply": false
  }
}
```

#### What It Changes

✅ **DO simplify**:
- Nested ternary → if-else or switch
- Deep nesting (>3 levels) → early returns or helper functions
- Single-letter variables → descriptive names
- `=== true` → truthy check

❌ **DON'T change**:
- API signatures or public exports
- Test file structure
- Meaningful comments (keep "why" comments)
- Architecture or design patterns

---

### Auto-Update on Session Start (v5.5.0)

Navigator v5.5.0 introduces **Auto-Update** - automatic plugin updates when you start a session.

#### Why Auto-Update

With 2x daily releases, manual `nav-upgrade` creates friction. Auto-update removes this barrier - just start your session and get the latest version automatically.

#### How It Works

1. On session start, Navigator checks for newer version
2. If update available AND `auto_update.enabled: true`:
   - Runs `claude plugin update navigator` (60s timeout)
   - If fails, tries uninstall/reinstall fallback
3. Shows result and continues session

#### Configuration

In `.agent/.nav-config.json`:
```json
{
  "auto_update": {
    "enabled": true,
    "check_interval_hours": 1
  }
}
```

- `enabled`: Enable/disable auto-update (default: true)
- `check_interval_hours`: Minimum hours between update checks (default: 1)

#### UX Flow

```
User: "Start my Navigator session"

[Checking for updates...]
[✅ Auto-updated to v5.5.1]

⚠️  RESTART REQUIRED
   Claude Code caches skill paths at session start.
   Restart Claude Code to load new skills from v5.5.1.

╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗
║  🚀 Navigator Session Started (v5.5.1) ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝
```

#### Edge Cases

- **Network failure**: Skip update, continue session
- **Update timeout**: Skip update, show warning, continue
- **Disabled in config**: Respects setting, just shows version notification
- **Recent check**: Skips if checked within `check_interval_hours`

#### Why Restart is Required

Claude Code caches skill definitions at session start. When Navigator updates mid-session:
- Plugin files update correctly (e.g., `~/.claude/plugins/cache/.../5.7.0/`)
- Active session still uses old cached paths (e.g., `.../5.3.0/`)
- New/updated skills won't be available until restart

This is Claude Code behavior, not a Navigator issue. The restart prompt ensures users get the updated skills.

#### Disabling Auto-Update

If you prefer manual control:
```json
{
  "auto_update": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

You'll still see update notifications - just run `nav-upgrade` manually when ready.

---

### Task Mode - Unified Workflow Orchestration (v5.6.0)

Navigator v5.6.0 introduces **Task Mode** - unified workflow orchestration that resolves conflicts between skills, loop mode, and CLAUDE.md workflows.

#### The Problem Task Mode Solves

Navigator had three disconnected workflow systems:
1. **Skills** (frontend-component, etc.) - have mini-workflows (Step 1 → Step 7)
2. **Loop Mode** - separate phase system (INIT → COMPLETE)
3. **CLAUDE.md** - documents workflow nobody enforces

**Result**: Conflicts when multiple systems try to run.

#### How Task Mode Works

```
User Request
    ↓
TASK MODE (auto-detect)
    ├─ Simple task? → Direct execution (no overhead)
    ├─ Skill matches? → Let skill run (it has workflow)
    └─ Substantial, no skill? → Task Mode phases
```

#### When Task Mode Activates

**Activates when**:
- Substantial work (complexity score >= 0.5)
- No matching skill detected
- Request involves planning, refactoring, or multi-file changes

**Does NOT activate when**:
- Trivial task (typo fix, single line change)
- Skill clearly matches (component creation, endpoint, migration)
- User says "quick", "just do", "simple fix"

#### Task Mode Phases

When activated, Task Mode provides phase guidance:

```
RESEARCH → PLAN → IMPL → VERIFY → COMPLETE
```

Each phase transition shows visual feedback:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PHASE: RESEARCH → PLAN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

RESEARCH completed:
  ✓ Found 5 related files
  ✓ Identified patterns in src/auth/

Moving to PLAN phase...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

#### Task Mode vs Loop Mode

| Aspect | Task Mode | Loop Mode |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Activation | Auto-detect | Explicit trigger |
| Iteration | None | EXIT_SIGNAL required |
| Skill coordination | Defers to skills | Independent |
| Best for | Features | Autonomous work |

**Can coexist**: Loop Mode wraps Task Mode phases if both active.

#### Configuration

In `.agent/.nav-config.json`:
```json
{
  "task_mode": {
    "enabled": true,
    "auto_detect": true,
    "defer_to_skills": true,
    "complexity_threshold": 0.5,
    "show_phase_indicator": true
  }
}
```

#### Examples

**Skill Deferral** (component creation):
```
User: "Create a UserProfile component"
→ Skill match: frontend-component (95% confidence)
→ Task Mode defers: "frontend-component skill will handle this"
```

**Task Mode Active** (refactoring):
```
User: "Refactor auth to use JWT"
→ Complexity: 0.8, No skill match
→ Task Mode activates with phase tracking
```

**Direct Execution** (simple fix):
```
User: "Fix the typo in README"
→ Complexity: 0.1
→ Direct execution (no overhead)
```

### Project Knowledge Graph (v6.0.0)

Navigator v6.0.0 introduces the **Project Knowledge Graph** - unified search across all project knowledge with experiential memory.

#### Why Knowledge Graph

Before v6.0.0, knowledge was siloed:
- Tasks in `.agent/tasks/`
- SOPs in `.agent/sops/`
- System docs in `.agent/system/`
- No way to query "What do we know about X?"

**Now**: One interface to query everything, plus memories that persist across sessions.

#### What It Provides

1. **Unified Search**: Query across tasks, SOPs, system docs, markers
2. **Experiential Memory**: Patterns, pitfalls, decisions, learnings
3. **Concept Indexing**: Auto-extracted concepts link related items
4. **Relationship Traversal**: Find what's related to what

#### Query Interface

```
"What do we know about auth?"
"Show everything related to payments"
"Any pitfalls for testing?"
"What decisions did we make about architecture?"
```

**Response format**:
```
Knowledge Graph: "auth"

TASKS (3)
  - TASK-29: Theory of Mind (completed)
  - TASK-05: Autonomous Completion (completed)
  - TASK-12: V3 Skills-Only (completed)

MEMORIES (2)
  - PITFALL: "Auth changes break session tests" (90%)
  - DECISION: "JWT over sessions for scaling" (95%)

SOPs (1)
  - DEV-003: Autonomous Completion

Load details: "Read TASK-29" or "Show auth pitfalls"
```

#### Memory Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Pattern** | "We use X for Y" | "JWT tokens for stateless auth" |
| **Pitfall** | "Watch out for X" | "Auth changes break session tests" |
| **Decision** | "We chose X because Y" | "JWT over sessions for scaling" |
| **Learning** | "X usually means Y" | "This error usually indicates Z" |

#### Capturing Memories

```
"Remember this pattern: we use X for Y"
"Remember this pitfall: watch out for X when..."
"Remember we decided to use X because..."
```

**Auto-capture** (if enabled):
- Corrections from nav-profile → memories
- Task decisions → memories

#### Configuration

In `.agent/.nav-config.json`:
```json
{
  "knowledge_graph": {
    "enabled": true,
    "auto_capture_corrections": true,
    "auto_capture_decisions": true,
    "auto_surface_relevant": true,
    "max_session_memories": 5,
    "confidence_decay_rate": 0.01,
    "staleness_threshold_days": 90,
    "git_tracked": true
  }
}
```

#### Token Budget

| Component | Tokens | When |
|-----------|--------|------|
| graph.json (50 nodes) | ~1000 | On query |
| Memory summaries (5) | ~500 | Session start |
| Full memory detail | ~500 each | On request |

**Session overhead**: ~1.3k tokens (well under 2k budget)

#### Initialization

First time:
```
"Initialize knowledge graph"
```

This scans `.agent/` and builds the initial graph from existing docs.

---

### Agents vs Skills - Token Optimization Strategy

Navigator uses **both strategically**:
- **Agents** = Research & exploration (separate context, 60-80% token savings)
- **Skills** = Execution & consistency (predefined functions/templates)

#### When to Use Agents

✅ **Multi-file codebase searches**
- Agent optimizes file reading (60-80% savings)
- Returns summary, not full files

✅ **Research tasks**
- Understanding unfamiliar code (70% savings)
- Reads only relevant sections

✅ **Multi-step investigations**
- Optimizes search strategy (65% savings)

✅ **Code pattern discovery**
- Samples representative files (75% savings)

❌ **Don't use agents for**:
- Reading specific known file
- Working with 1-2 already loaded files
- Small edits to current context

**Example**:
```
User: "Add rate limiting to all API endpoints"

WRONG: Grep → Read 20 files manually = 100k+ tokens
CORRECT: Task agent → Returns 3 relevant files = 8k tokens (92% savings)
```

#### When to Use Skills

✅ **Implementing features** following patterns
- Auto-invokes on natural language
- Uses predefined functions + templates
- Ensures consistency

✅ **Generating boilerplate** code
- Templates enforce format
- Functions handle validation

✅ **Enforcing project** conventions
- Examples guide implementation
- Zero manual command memorization

**Decision Matrix**:

| Scenario | Use |
|----------|-----|
| "How does auth work?" | **Agent** |
| "Find all endpoints" | **Agent** |
| "Create component" | **Skill** |
| "Add endpoint" | **Skill** |
| "Understand codebase" | **Agent** |
| "Generate boilerplate" | **Skill** |

**Key principle**: Agents for exploration, Skills for execution.

---

### Smart Compact Strategy

**Run compact after**:
- Completing isolated sub-task
- Finishing documentation update
- Switching between unrelated tasks

**Don't compact when**:
- In middle of feature
- Context needed for next sub-task
- Debugging complex issue

---

## Code Standards

- **Architecture**: KISS, DRY, SOLID principles
- **Components**: Framework best practices
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode (if applicable), no `any` without justification
- **Line Length**: Max 100 characters
- **Testing**: High coverage (backend 90%+, frontend 85%+)

---

## Forbidden Actions

### Navigator Violations (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- ❌ NEVER skip WORKFLOW CHECK block on task requests
  → Must show: Loop trigger? Complexity? Mode?
  → See: [WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT](#workflow-enforcement-mandatory---read-first)
- ❌ NEVER ignore Loop Mode triggers ("run until done", "do all", etc.)
  → Must activate Loop Mode with NAVIGATOR_STATUS blocks
- ❌ NEVER skip complexity check on substantial tasks
  → Multi-file, refactoring, features → Task Mode required
- ❌ NEVER wait for explicit commit prompts (autonomous mode)
  → See: `.agent/philosophy/PATTERNS.md` (Autonomous Completion pattern)
- ❌ NEVER leave tickets open after completion
- ❌ NEVER skip documentation after features
- ❌ NEVER load all `.agent/` docs at once
  → See: `.agent/philosophy/ANTI-PATTERNS.md` (Upfront Loading anti-pattern)
- ❌ NEVER skip reading DEVELOPMENT-README.md
  → See: `.agent/philosophy/PATTERNS.md` (Lazy Loading pattern)
- ❌ NEVER manually Read multiple files when Task agent should be used
  → See: `.agent/philosophy/PATTERNS.md` (Direct MCP pattern)

### General Violations
- ❌ No Claude Code mentions in commits/code
- ❌ No package.json modifications without approval
- ❌ Never commit secrets/API keys/.env files
- ❌ Don't delete tests without replacement

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Start Session** → "Start my Navigator session"
2. **Select Task** → Load task doc (`.agent/tasks/TASK-XX.md`)
3. **Research** → Use Task agent for multi-file searches (NOT manual Read)
4. **Plan** → Use TodoWrite for complex tasks
5. **Implement** → Follow patterns, write tests
6. **Verify** → Run tests, confirm functionality
7. **Simplify** → [AUTO] Code clarity improvements (if enabled)
8. **Complete** → [AUTONOMOUS] Commit, document, close ticket, create marker
9. **Compact** → Clear context for next task

---

## Documentation System
