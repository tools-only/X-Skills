# Meet Your Team

Claude Copilot gives you access to **14 specialized agents**—each an expert in their domain, built using the **lean agent model** with on-demand skill loading.

## Architecture: Lean Agents + Deep Skills

Agents are kept minimal (under 120 lines) and auto-load domain expertise on demand. Shared boilerplate (skill loading, Task Copilot pattern, iteration loop, return format, etc.) is extracted to the "Agent Shared Behaviors" section in CLAUDE.md, so individual agent files contain only domain-specific logic.

| Component | Size | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Agent file | Under 120 lines | Core workflow, routing, behaviors |
| Shared behaviors | In CLAUDE.md | Skill loading, Task Copilot, iteration, handoffs |
| Skills | ~200-500 lines each | Domain patterns, anti-patterns, examples |
| Total context | ~1,000 tokens | Agent + relevant skills only |

**How it works:**
1. Agent calls `skill_evaluate({ files, text })` to detect relevant skills
2. Skills ranked by confidence (file patterns + keyword matching)
3. Agent loads top skills via `@include` directive
4. Work executes with specialized knowledge

**Benefits:**
- ~70% less context per agent (3,000 → 1,000 tokens)
- Skills loaded only when needed
- Extensible without modifying agents
- Faster agent startup

### Required Tools

All lean agents MUST include these tools:

| Tool / Command | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `skill_evaluate` | Auto-detect and load skills (Skills Copilot MCP) |
| `tc task get <id> --json` | Retrieve task details |
| `tc task update <id> --status <s> --json` | Update task status |
| `tc wp store --task <id> ...` | Store output |

> **Note:** `preflight_check` has been replaced by `tc task get <id> --json` which returns task state including environment context.

### Skill Metadata

Skills must have trigger metadata for auto-detection:

```yaml
---
skill_name: python-idioms
trigger_files: ["*.py", "**/*.py", "requirements.txt"]
trigger_keywords: [python, django, flask, pytest, pythonic]
---
```

### Extension Compatibility

Extensions continue to work with lean agents:

| Extension Type | Behavior |
|----------------|----------|
| `override` | Replaces the lean agent entirely |
| `extension` | Adds sections to the lean agent |
| `skills` | Injects additional skills |

---

## How Agents Collaborate

Agents don't work in isolation—they route to each other based on expertise.

| Any | `doc` | Documentation needed |

## Task Copilot Integration

Lean agents store their detailed work products in Task Copilot instead of returning them to the main session. This reduces context usage by ~96%.

### How It Works

```
User Request: "Design the auth system"
         │
         ▼
    @agent-ta (lean agent)
         │
         ├──→ Calls skill_evaluate() to load relevant skills
         │
         ├──→ Creates PRD, breaks down tasks
         │
         ├──→ Stores PRD in Task Copilot (tc prd create ...)
         │
         ├──→ Creates tasks (tc task create ...)
         │
         └──→ Returns summary to main session (~100 tokens)
              "Created PRD-001 with 5 tasks. Ready to proceed."
```

### Work Product Types

Each agent stores specific types of work:

| Agent | Work Product Type | What's Stored |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| `ta` | `architecture`, `technical_design` | System designs, ADRs, task breakdowns |
| `me` | `implementation` | Code changes, refactoring notes |
| `qa` | `test_plan` | Test strategies, coverage reports |
| `sec` | `security_review` | Vulnerability assessments, threat models |
| `doc` | `documentation` | API docs, guides, READMEs |
| `do` | `technical_design` | Pipeline configs, infrastructure designs |
| `sd`, `uxd`, `uids`, `uid`, `cw` | `other` | Journey maps, wireframes, design specs, copy |

### Benefits

- **Reduced context**: Main session stays focused (~200 tokens vs ~8000)
- **Persistent storage**: Work products survive session restarts
- **Progress tracking**: `tc progress --json` shows compact status
- **Work retrieval**: `tc wp get <id> --json` retrieves full details when needed

### Agent Workflow

1. Agent receives task (with Task ID if assigned)
2. Agent stores detailed work in Task Copilot
3. Agent returns minimal summary to main session
4. Main session continues with low context overhead

---

## Custom Agents

Teams can add domain-specific agents. Example with a custom `@agent-cpa`:

```
User Request: "Add expense reporting with tax categorization"
         │
         ▼
    @agent-ta ──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    (designs data model, API structure)                      │
         │                                                   │
         ├──→ @agent-cpa (tax categories, compliance rules) │  ← Your custom agent
         │         │                                         │
         │         └──→ returns IRS category mappings        │
         │                                                   │
         └──→ @agent-me (implementation) ◄──────────────────┘
                   │
                   ├──→ @agent-sec (financial data protection)
                   │
                   └──→ @agent-cpa (validates tax logic)
```

Your CPA agent encodes tax law expertise, IRS requirements, and accounting standards—knowledge that doesn't exist in generic AI tools.

See [Customization](CUSTOMIZATION.md) for how to create custom agents.

## Invoking Agents

Agents are automatically routed when you use `/protocol`. You can also invoke them directly:

| Method | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Via protocol | `/protocol` then describe your task |
| Direct mention | `@agent-ta design the auth system` |
| Task tool | `subagent_type: "ta"` |
