# Adaptive UX Scheduling (React 18)

## Summary

Adapt UI scheduling behavior dynamically based on runtime conditions and user context.

## Key Capabilities

- Adjust update priority using telemetry signals.
- Tailor rendering schedules based on device capability.
- Implement fallback paths for low-resource environments.

## PhD-Level Challenges

- Model scheduling adaptation as a control system.
- Prove stability of adaptation loops under noisy signals.
- Quantify UX gains across device classes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Demonstrate adaptive scheduling in a multi-device test.
- Provide metrics for improved responsiveness.
- Document adaptation policies and guardrails.
