- Queue Freezing Synchronization Rule: When analyzing potential races between
  bio completion paths and queue teardown functions: blk_mq_freeze_queue()
  ensures all in-flight bios complete by waiting for q->q_usage_counter to
  reach zero. Since every bio holds a reference to q->q_usage_counter from
  submission (blk_try_enter_queue) to completion (blk_queue_exit), teardown
  functions cannot complete while bios with QoS flags are still executing their
  completion paths.
- bio chains are formed as the result of merging tests.  These establish
  rules about what bios are allowed to be mixed together.  If you find a bug
  related to chains of bios, first make sure the merging rules allows that
  chain to exist

## Bio Mempool Allocation Guarantees

Bio allocations with GFP_NOIO/GFP_NOFS cannot fail (mempool guarantee via
`__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM`). ENOMEM paths only reachable with GFP_ATOMIC/GFP_NOWAIT.

- `bio_alloc_bioset()` - mempool alloc, cannot fail with GFP_NOIO
- `bvec_alloc()` - falls back to mempool with `__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM`
- `bio_integrity_prep()` - uses GFP_NOIO, cannot fail
- `bio_integrity_alloc_buf()` - uses GFP_NOFS, cannot fail

Load block specific rules:
- **BLOCK-001** (patterns/BLOCK-001.md): Mandatory when struct bios are passed or used
