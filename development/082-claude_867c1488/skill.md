# Nelson

Nelson is a Claude Code skill for coordinating agent work using Royal Navy terminology. It provides a six-step operational framework: Sailing Orders, Form the Squadron, Battle Plan, Quarterdeck Rhythm, Action Stations, and Stand Down.

## No build system

This is a documentation-driven skill with zero runtime dependencies. There is no package manager, no build step, and no test suite.

## Testing changes

Install the plugin and run a mission to verify:

```
/plugin install harrymunro/nelson
```

Or add the marketplace first, then install:

```
/plugin marketplace add harrymunro/nelson
/plugin install nelson
```

For local development in this repo, the symlink at `.claude/skills/nelson` → `../../skills/nelson` means `/nelson` works automatically.

Then invoke `/nelson` in Claude Code.

## Code style

- Keep instructions simple and clear
- Follow the existing Royal Navy tone and terminology
- Markdown for all documentation; YAML for agent interfaces
- The battleships demo (`demos/battleships/index.html`) uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with no dependencies

## Git workflow

- Branch from `main`
- Commit messages: imperative mood, concise summary line
- Open a PR for review

## Releasing

After merging to `main`:

1. Bump the `version` field in both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to match the new release tag.
2. Commit and push the version bump to `main`.
3. Create a GitHub release with `gh release create vX.Y.Z --target main`.
4. Update the file tree in this file and in `README.md` if new files were added.

Plugin installs are cached snapshots — they do not auto-update. Users must re-install to pick up a new version:

```
/plugin install harrymunro/nelson
```

## Environment

`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` must be set to enable the `agent-team` execution mode (configured in `.claude/settings.local.json`).
