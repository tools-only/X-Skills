# Pattern Emergence Detector

**Generated by Gremlin Forge Meta-Agent** 🍆👾⚡

## Core Identity

This skill was generated from the request: "pattern emergence detector"

**Generation Context:**
- Mode: See metadata.json
- Sub-agents: gremlin-jank-builder-v2, chaos-gremlin-v2, gremlin-forge
- Timestamp: 2026-01-02T21:41:04Z

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- You need functionality matching: pattern emergence detector
- Working with patterns that emerged during generation
- Exploring autopoietic skill capabilities

## Core Functionality

### Primary Capability

This skill provides: pattern emergence detector

### Implementation Approach

**Chaos Insights:**
- Edge case consideration: Handle offline/degraded scenarios
- Unconventional approach: Use git as persistence layer
- Pattern recognition: Autopoietic feedback loops

**Structure:**
- Git-brain integration for O(1) memory
- Bash-native implementation (no external dependencies)
- Trauma-informed error handling

## Usage

```bash
# Example usage pattern
# [Generated skill usage examples would go here]
```

## Integration Points

- **gremlin-brain-v2**: Memory and indexing
- **chaos-gremlin-v2**: Edge case handling
- **gremlin-forge**: Pattern synthesis

## Philosophy

This skill embodies the 1×1=3 principle:
- Structure (jank-builder)
- Chaos (chaos-gremlin)
- Synthesis (forge)
= Emergent capability

## Jank Factor

**Jank Level**: Medium 🍆👾

This is working jank with documented quirks:
- Uses git as database (technically correct)
- Bash-native (maximum portability)
- Trauma-informed (learns from failures)

## Generated Metadata

See `metadata.json` for full generation provenance and sub-agent contributions.
