## Overview

Fly.io is a developer-focused cloud platform that runs application code inside Firecracker microVMs, providing hardware-level isolation, sub-second startup times, and global anycast networking across 18 regions. It positions itself as compute that "gets out of the way" — deploy any container or binary with `fly launch`, pay per-second for actual usage, and get globally-distributed infrastructure without managing Kubernetes or Terraform. In 2025-2026 Fly.io extended the platform with **Sprites** (`sprites.dev`), persistent stateful sandboxes purpose-built for running AI coding agents like Claude Code at scale.

## Problem Addressed

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Cold-start latency kills serverless apps | Firecracker microVMs boot in < 1 second, fast enough to handle HTTP requests |
| "Noisy neighbor" on shared runtimes | KVM hardware isolation; CPU cores dedicated to one microVM at a time |
| Complex global distribution | BGP anycast + 18 regions; traffic routed to closest available VM automatically |
| Stateless-only serverless platforms | Fly Volumes (persistent NVMe), Fly Postgres, and Sprite checkpointing for stateful workloads |
| AI agents need isolated execution environments | Sprites provide per-agent VMs with private filesystems, checkpoints, and rollback |
| Unsafe execution of AI-generated code | Hardware-isolated sandboxes (Sprites) let untrusted code run in complete safety |
| Complex multi-service private networking | Automatic WireGuard mesh (6PN); apps resolve peers via `.internal` DNS, zero config |
| Expensive always-on compute | Per-second billing, Machines stop when idle, minimum 6.25% CPU granularity |

## Key Features

### Fly Machines (Core Compute)

- Firecracker-based microVMs; hardware-isolated via KVM
- Sub-second start/stop; suitable for handling individual HTTP requests
- Full lifecycle control via REST API (`https://api.machines.dev`) or `flyctl`
- Configure CPU (shared or dedicated), RAM, region, and environment variables per Machine
- Autoscale to tens of thousands of instances programmatically
- Per-second billing — machines stopped when idle cost nothing

### Sprites (Agent Sandboxes)

- Persistent, stateful Linux environments backed by Firecracker microVMs
- Designed for AI coding agents (Claude Code, reasoning LLMs) and untrusted code execution
- Checkpoint & restore: snapshot full VM state; roll back if anything breaks
- Fast startup: 1–12 seconds; auto-shutoff when idle
- HTTP endpoint per Sprite for webhooks, serving APIs, and public sharing
- CLI (`sprite`), REST API (`api.sprites.dev`), TypeScript SDK (`@fly/sprites`), Go SDK
- Non-Docker storage stack with NVMe for durability and performance

### Global Networking (BGP Anycast + WireGuard)

- BGP anycast: IPs broadcast from all datacenters; connections routed to closest VM
- `fly-proxy`: Rust-based proxy on every server handles TLS termination, backhaul, routing
- WireGuard backhaul between datacenters; connections traverse minimal additional latency
- **6PN (IPv6 Private Network)**: automatic encrypted mesh across all apps in an org
- `.internal` DNS: apps resolve each other by name without public exposure
- Flycast: internal load balancing and traffic steering for multi-region topologies
- Connect external nodes (laptops, other clouds) to the private network via `fly wireguard create`

### Persistent Storage

- **Fly Volumes**: regional NVMe-backed persistent disks; attach to Machines for stateful apps
- **Fly Postgres (Managed)**: HA Postgres with automatic failover, daily backups, replication
- **Fly Postgres (Unmanaged)**: self-managed Postgres running as a Fly app on volumes
- Object storage available through Tigris (S3-compatible, globally distributed)
- Sprite storage: hot NVMe cache ($0.000683/GB-hour) + durable bucket storage ($0.000027/GB-hour)

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- Fly.io has first-class MCP documentation and tooling at `fly.io/docs/mcp/`
- `fly mcp launch`: one-command deployment of `npx`, `uv`, `go run`, or Docker stdio MCP servers
- Fly MCP server (`fly-mcp`): community Go server to manage Fly.io infrastructure via Claude
- Remote MCP servers on Fly.io connect to Claude via `mcp_servers` array in the Messages API
- MCP servers run as single-Machine apps (non-HA) to preserve stateful protocol sessions
- Transport options: stdio (local), SSE, and Streamable HTTP (for remote Fly-hosted servers)

### Developer Experience

- `fly launch`: auto-detects frameworks, generates `fly.toml`, builds image, deploys
- `fly deploy`: rebuild and redeploy with zero downtime rolling updates
- `fly ssh console`: SSH into any running Machine
- `fly logs`, `fly status`, `fly scale`: observability and scaling commands
- CI/CD integration supported; deploy tokens scoped per environment
- SOC2 Type 2 attested; Single Sign-On for enterprise

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

### Applications

- **Run Claude Code as an agent on Sprites**: Sprites are explicitly designed for AI coding agents like Claude Code; each gets an isolated VM with persistent filesystem, checkpointing, and rollback
- **Deploy MCP servers**: Host any MCP server on Fly.io with `fly mcp launch`; connect Claude to it via the Messages API `mcp_servers` field
- **Safe code execution sandbox**: Execute AI-generated or user-provided code in hardware-isolated Sprite VMs — prevents prompt injection from compromising host systems
- **Deploy skills/agent backends globally**: Fly.io's 18-region deployment means Claude-powered APIs respond with sub-100ms latency to users worldwide
- **Persistent agent state**: Use Fly Volumes or Sprite storage for agents that need to remember context across sessions, build SQLite databases, or maintain project state
- **Orchestrate multi-agent swarms**: Machines API allows programmatic creation/destruction of thousands of ephemeral VMs — each agent gets its own isolated compute

### Patterns Worth Adopting

- **Checkpoint/restore for reproducibility**: Sprite checkpoints enable saving a known-good state before risky agent operations and rolling back on failure
- **Per-agent VM isolation**: Instead of shared runtimes, give each agent instance its own microVM to eliminate noisy-neighbor interference and security cross-contamination
- **MCP-over-HTTP**: Deploy Claude Code skills as stateful MCP servers on Fly.io for remote team access; use SSE transport for persistent connections
- **Internal DNS for service discovery**: Use `.internal` addresses to wire together agent components (coordinator, executor, storage) without exposing them publicly
- **Per-second billing for burst workloads**: Agent workloads are often bursty; Fly's billing model ensures idle agents cost nothing while allowing rapid scale-up

### Integration Opportunities

- **fly-mcp**: Deploy the open-source `fly-mcp` Go server to allow Claude to manage Fly.io infrastructure via natural language (provision apps, check stats, scale services)
- **Claude Code + Sprites REST API**: Use `@fly/sprites` TypeScript SDK or `api.sprites.dev` REST API to programmatically provision sandboxes for each Claude Code task
- **FLAME pattern on Fly.io**: Fly.io's documentation references Elixir FLAME for spawning function-level VMs; the same pattern applies to spawning Claude sub-agents in isolated Machines
- **Fly Postgres as agent memory**: Use Fly Postgres with pgvector for long-term semantic memory stores accessible to agents via the private 6PN network
- **GitHub Actions → Fly Deploy**: CI/CD workflow where Claude Code generates code, tests pass, and `flyctl` deploys automatically to Fly.io
