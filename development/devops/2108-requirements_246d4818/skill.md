# S04 Service Validation - Requirements

## Business Context

### Customer Profile

**Company**: Contoso Healthcare Systems  
**Industry**: Healthcare Technology  
**Size**: Mid-market (500-2000 employees)  
**Region**: Europe (GDPR compliance required)  
**Current State**: Migrating legacy applications to Azure

### Business Challenge

Contoso Healthcare is undergoing a digital transformation and migrating their patient management system to Azure. As part of their Azure Infrastructure Specialization journey, they must demonstrate **Module B Control 4.1: Service Validation and Testing**.

**Key Pain Points:**

1. **Manual Testing Overhead**: Current validation process takes 40+ hours per release
2. **Inconsistent Testing**: Different testers use different approaches, leading to gaps
3. **Audit Requirements**: Healthcare regulations require documented evidence of testing
4. **Performance Unknown**: No baseline metrics for service performance
5. **Downtime Risk**: Lack of resilience testing leads to unexpected outages

### Business Objectives

1. **Reduce Validation Time**: Cut testing cycle from 40 hours to < 10 hours (75% reduction)
2. **Automate Testing**: Implement automated load testing, API validation, and resilience checks
3. **Audit Compliance**: Generate audit-ready validation reports with evidence
4. **Performance Baseline**: Establish and track performance metrics over time
5. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure 99.9% availability and < 500ms response times

- Managed identities configured
- No secrets in code or configuration
- Security headers present (X-Frame-Options, etc.)
