## Description

Refactor oversized or multi-domain skills into smaller, purpose-built skills while preserving full fidelity and capability coverage. Use when a skill spans too many topics, exceeds ~500 lines, or would benefit from clearer separation of concerns and independent invocation. This skill reviews the existing content, identifies logical boundaries, designs a split plan, generates new SKILL.md files for each extracted skill, and validates that the refactor maintains complete functional and content parity with the original.

**Tags:** `development`
