## Overview

PocketBase is an open-source Go backend that ships as a single self-contained executable, bundling an embedded SQLite database with realtime subscriptions, built-in auth management (password, OTP, OAuth2, MFA), file storage, and a superuser dashboard UI — all exposed via a REST-ish API. It can be used as a zero-config standalone app or as a Go library to add custom routes, hooks, and business logic while keeping a single portable binary as the output.

## Problem Addressed

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Setting up a backend requires wiring together a web framework, database, auth system, file storage, and admin UI | Single executable includes all of these; run `./pocketbase serve` and the full backend is live |
| Auth systems require significant custom code for OAuth2, OTP, MFA, and email verification | Built-in auth collections with configurable password, OTP, OAuth2 (30+ providers), and MFA support |
| Prototypes and hobby projects are abandoned due to backend complexity | Sub-5-minute setup from download to working API with dashboard |
| Realtime features require external brokers (Redis, Pusher, WebSocket servers) | Built-in SSE-based realtime subscriptions on any collection out of the box |
| File uploads need separate S3 configuration and storage logic | Built-in file field type; storage switches between local disk and S3 via config |
| Database schema management is manual and error-prone | Collections and fields managed via dashboard UI or Go/JS migration files that can be committed to git |

## Key Features

### Embedded Database

- SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go, no CGO required)
- 3 collection types: **Base** (application data), **View** (read-only SQL SELECT), **Auth** (users with auth fields)
- 15+ field types: bool, number, text, email, URL, editor, date, autodate, select, file, relation, JSON, geopoint, password, number
- Declarative filter rules per collection (`@request.auth.id`, `&&`, `||`, nesting)
- Realtime SSE subscriptions on any collection with automatic event broadcasting
- Incremental schema migrations stored as JS/Go files committable to git

### Authentication

- **Email/password** with configurable identity field (default email, any unique field)
- **OTP** (one-time password via email code) with auto-verify-on-success option
- **OAuth2** via 30+ providers (Google, GitHub, Microsoft, GitLab, etc.) — single-call popup flow
- **Multi-factor authentication** (MFA) — combine any two auth methods
- Stateless JWT tokens; no server-side session storage; "logout" = discard token client-side
- Multiple Auth collections with independent fields and rules (users, managers, clients, etc.)
- Role-based and ownership-based access via filter rule expressions

### File Storage

- File field type stores filenames in SQLite; file content on local disk or S3
- Single or multiple file uploads per field; set modifiers to append/prepend/remove files
- Thumbnails and image processing configurable per file field

### Admin Dashboard

- Superuser dashboard at `/_/` for managing collections, records, auth, logs, and settings
- Schema changes in the dashboard auto-generate JS migration files
- Superuser accounts managed via `./pocketbase superuser` CLI subcommands

### REST-ish API

- CRUD endpoints auto-generated for every collection
- Filter, sort, expand (relations), and fields projection query parameters
- Standard routes: `http://127.0.0.1:8090/api/`
- Static file serving from `pb_public/` directory

### Go Framework Mode

- Import `github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase` as a library to add custom routes, middleware, and hooks
- Hook system (`app.OnServe()`, `app.OnRecordCreate()`, etc.) for lifecycle event interception
- JS VM plugin (enabled by default in prebuilt binary) for extending with JavaScript without recompilation
- Single `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build` produces a statically linked binary for any target

## Technical Architecture

### Deployment Modes

<eg>
Standalone mode (prebuilt binary):
  Download → extract → ./pocketbase serve
  → localhost:8090/api/      (REST API)
  → localhost:8090/_/        (Admin dashboard)
  → localhost:8090/          (Static files from pb_public/)

Go framework mode:
  go mod init myapp && go mod tidy
  → import pocketbase, add hooks/routes
  → CGO_ENABLED=0 go build → single binary
</eg>

### Data Directories

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `pb_data/` | Application data, SQLite DB, uploaded files (gitignore) |
| `pb_migrations/` | JS/Go migration files with schema changes (commit to git) |
| `pb_public/` | Static files served at root URL |

### Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Language | Go 1.23+ |
| Database | SQLite (modernc.org/sqlite, pure Go) |
| Realtime | SSE (Server-Sent Events) |
| Auth tokens | JWT (stateless) |
| File storage | Local disk or S3 |
| JS extensibility | Goja JS VM |
| Admin UI | Embedded SvelteKit SPA |

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# Download prebuilt binary (Linux amd64)
wget https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/download/v0.36.5/pocketbase_0.36.5_linux_amd64.zip
unzip pocketbase_0.36.5_linux_amd64.zip

# Start server (auto-opens browser for first superuser setup)
./pocketbase serve

# Self-update
./pocketbase update
```

### JavaScript SDK Usage

```javascript
import PocketBase from 'pocketbase';
const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');

// Authenticate
const authData = await pb.collection('users').authWithPassword('user@example.com', 'password');

// CRUD
const record = await pb.collection('posts').create({ title: 'Hello', content: 'World' });
const list = await pb.collection('posts').getList(1, 20, { filter: 'author = "abc123"' });

// Realtime subscription
pb.collection('posts').subscribe('*', (e) => {
    console.log(e.action, e.record);
});
```

### Go Framework Extension

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase"
    "github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/core"
)

func main() {
    app := pocketbase.New()

    app.OnServe().BindFunc(func(se *core.ServeEvent) error {
        se.Router.GET("/hello", func(re *core.RequestEvent) error {
            return re.String(200, "Hello world!")
        })
        return se.Next()
    })

    if err := app.Start(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

### Applications

- **Rapid backend for skill prototypes**: PocketBase provides an instant backend for any skill or agent that needs persistent data, user auth, or file storage — no cloud account or database setup required.
- **Agent state persistence**: Use PocketBase collections as a lightweight external state store for multi-session agent workflows, replacing ad-hoc file-based or SQLite-from-scratch approaches.
- **Tool backend for MCP servers**: PocketBase's REST API and realtime subscriptions make it a natural backend for MCP servers that need persistent records and push notifications to connected clients.
- **Local BaaS for development**: Replaces Firebase/Supabase for local-first development; single binary spun up in CI for integration tests without external dependencies.

### Patterns Worth Adopting

1. **Single-binary distribution**: PocketBase's zero-dependency `CGO_ENABLED=0` build producing a static binary is a pattern for distributing agent tools without runtime requirements.
2. **Migration files as code**: Storing schema changes as committable JS migration files enables reproducible database state — applicable to any tool that manages structured data.
3. **Filter rule DSL**: PocketBase's `@request.auth.id`, `&&`/`||`, nested relation traversal rule syntax is a clean pattern for declarative access control without custom middleware code.
4. **Hook-based extensibility**: The `app.On*()` hook pattern for intercepting lifecycle events (create, update, delete) without forking the core — directly applicable to plugin architectures.
5. **Realtime without extra infrastructure**: SSE-based subscriptions baked into the core (no Redis, no Pusher) demonstrate that realtime can be a zero-dependency first-class feature.

### Integration Opportunities

1. **PocketBase as skill session store**: A `sessions` collection in PocketBase could replace the current `sessions/` directory pattern for tracking multi-session agent context with query support.
2. **MCP server backed by PocketBase**: Build an MCP server that exposes PocketBase CRUD operations as tools, giving Claude Code agents structured persistent storage via the Tool use interface.
3. **Research entry tracking**: Use PocketBase to store, query, and track research entries by category/date/freshness — enabling `--validate` and `--rerun` mode queries without scanning the filesystem.
4. **Webhook hooks for agent triggers**: PocketBase's `OnRecord*` hooks can fire webhooks that trigger agent tasks (e.g., new research entry created → trigger `--validate` workflow).

### Competitive Analysis

| Tool | Comparison |
|------|------------|
| Supabase | Hosted PostgreSQL BaaS; PocketBase is lighter, self-hosted, no Docker required |
| Firebase | Google-hosted; PocketBase is open source, runs offline, no vendor lock-in |
| Appwrite | Docker-based multi-service; PocketBase is a single binary |
| Directus | CMS-focused, requires Node.js; PocketBase is Go, self-contained |
