## Overview

Bifrost is a high-performance AI gateway built in Go by Maxim (maximhq) that provides a unified OpenAI-compatible HTTP API across 20+ LLM providers. It focuses on enterprise reliability (automatic fallbacks, adaptive load balancing, clustering) and developer ergonomics (drop-in URL replacement, zero-config startup, web UI). The gateway adds only 11 µs of overhead per request on adequate hardware at 5,000 RPS sustained load. The project also includes a Go SDK for embedded deployment without the HTTP layer.

Key differentiator from comparable tools (LiteLLM, TensorZero): the README explicitly benchmarks 50x faster than LiteLLM, positions as an enterprise gateway rather than an LLMOps platform, and ships MCP gateway support as a first-class feature.

## Key Features

### Unified Provider Gateway

- **OpenAI-compatible API**: Single endpoint accepts standard chat completion, embeddings, and multimodal requests regardless of target provider
- **22 provider implementations**: Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Cerebras, Cohere, ElevenLabs, Gemini (Google), Groq, Hugging Face, Mistral, Nebius, Ollama, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Parasail, Perplexity, Replicate, Runway, SGLang, Vertex AI, vLLM, xAI
- **Drop-in replacement**: Change only `base_url` in existing OpenAI/Anthropic/GenAI SDK code — no other modifications
- **Model addressing**: Use `provider/model-name` format (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`)

### Reliability and Load Management

- **Automatic fallbacks**: Configurable fallback chains across providers and models; requests retry transparently on provider failure
- **Adaptive load balancing**: Weighted distribution across multiple API keys; ~10 ns key selection time
- **Routing rules**: CEL (Common Expression Language) builder for conditional request routing; case-insensitive header matching
- **Clustering**: Multi-node deployment mode for high-availability production workloads (enterprise)

### Performance

- **11 µs gateway overhead** at 5,000 RPS on t3.xlarge (59 µs on t3.medium)
- **100% success rate** sustained at 5,000 RPS in benchmark tests
- **Sub-microsecond queue wait** (1.67 µs average on t3.xlarge)
- **Asynchronous inference support** added in v1.4.8

### Semantic Caching

- Dual-layer: exact hash match first, then vector similarity search (configurable threshold, default 0.8)
- Direct hash mode for exact matching without embedding API calls
- Backend options: Weaviate, Redis (RediSearch), Qdrant, Pinecone
- TTL configuration, per-model/provider cache isolation
- Cache key via `x-bf-cache-key` request header

### MCP Gateway

- Acts as both MCP client and MCP server
- Tool execution with approval controls and auto-approval agent mode
- Code mode for Python orchestration (50% fewer tokens, 40% lower latency per documentation)
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with token refresh for MCP tool providers
- Custom tool registration and exposure

### Governance and Access Control

- Virtual keys with permission scopes and allowed model lists
- Hierarchical budgets: virtual key, team, and customer-level cost limits
- Rate limiting with configurable policies
- Required headers enforcement on every request (added v1.4.8)
- SSO via Google and GitHub; Okta/Entra for enterprise

### Observability

### Configuration Model

Two mutually exclusive configuration modes:

1. **Web UI mode**: SQLite database (`config.db`) stores configuration; changes apply without restart via the web interface
2. **File-based mode**: Static `config.json` loaded at startup; requires restart for changes; held in memory only

Data directories:

- `config.db` — provider and gateway configuration (web UI mode)
- `logs.db` — request log database
- Vector store connection — external (Weaviate, Redis, Qdrant, Pinecone)

### Request Flow

1. Client sends OpenAI-compatible request to Bifrost HTTP endpoint
2. Routing rules (CEL expressions) evaluated against request headers/body
3. Provider and model resolved from `provider/model` identifier in request
4. API key selected from weighted pool (~10 ns selection time)
5. Request forwarded to provider with auth headers injected
6. On failure: automatic retry or fallback chain traversal
7. Response logged to `logs.db` with metadata
8. Governance plugin enforces budget and rate limit accounting
9. Semantic cache populated if caching is enabled for the key

### Language Breakdown

## Relevance to Claude Code Development

### Direct Applications

1. **Multi-Provider Routing for Skill Agents**: Bifrost's fallback chains and load balancing provide a reference pattern for routing Claude Code agent tasks across multiple providers when Anthropic APIs are unavailable or rate-limited.

2. **MCP Gateway Reference Implementation**: Bifrost's MCP gateway feature (OAuth 2.0 tool auth, approval controls, agent auto-approval mode) offers implementation patterns relevant to building Claude Code skills that orchestrate MCP tools at scale.

3. **Virtual Key Governance**: The hierarchical virtual key system (key-level, team-level, customer-level budgets) demonstrates access control patterns applicable to multi-tenant Claude Code deployments where different teams need isolated LLM budget controls.

4. **Semantic Caching for Repeated Skill Calls**: Skills that invoke similar prompts repeatedly (e.g., code review, documentation generation) could benefit from Bifrost's dual-layer semantic cache to reduce latency and API costs.

5. **OpenAI-Compatible Interface as Abstraction Layer**: Using Bifrost as a backend allows Claude Code skill integrations to target a stable OpenAI-compatible API regardless of which underlying provider is active.

### Patterns Worth Adopting

1. **Dual-layer caching**: Exact hash check before vector similarity avoids embedding API calls for repeated identical requests — applicable to skill response caching.

2. **CEL-based routing rules**: Using Common Expression Language for request routing conditions provides a declarative, testable routing DSL that could inform Claude Code's task dispatch logic.

3. **Plugin architecture with separate semver**: Each plugin (governance, semanticcache, telemetry) has its own semantic versioning. This pattern reduces coupling and allows selective upgrades.

4. **Zero-config startup with progressive configuration**: Start with defaults via `npx` or Docker, then configure progressively through the web UI — a UX pattern applicable to Claude Code skill installation.

5. **10 ns key selection**: Weighted API key selection at nanosecond speed demonstrates that load balancing overhead need not be measurable at the application level.

### Integration Opportunities

1. **Anthropic API Proxy**: Run Bifrost as a local proxy for Claude API calls to get automatic retry, fallback to other models when Claude is overloaded, and semantic caching of repeated prompts.

2. **MCP Tool Orchestration Layer**: Use Bifrost as a centralized MCP gateway for Claude Code multi-agent workflows where agents need to share access to external tools with proper authentication.

3. **Cost Governance for Agent Workflows**: Apply Bifrost's budget enforcement to control LLM spend across parallel Claude Code agent tasks spawned via the Task tool.

4. **Observability Pipeline**: Route all LLM calls through Bifrost to collect unified Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry traces for Claude Code skill performance monitoring.

### Comparison with TensorZero
