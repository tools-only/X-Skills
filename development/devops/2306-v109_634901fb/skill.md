# Release v1.0.9 - Performance & Infrastructure Optimization

**January 2026**

---

## Major Features

### Multi-stage Docker Builds & Image Optimization

Dramatically reduced Docker image sizes and improved build performance:

- **Registry Image**: Reduced from 4.79GB to 1.64GB (66% reduction)
- **mcpgw Server**: Reduced from 7.78GB to ~1.5GB (80% reduction)
- **Build Context**: Optimized from 1.77GB to <500MB
- **Multi-stage Architecture**: 3-stage builds (frontend → backend → runtime)
- **CPU-only PyTorch**: Using PyTorch 2.0+ CPU wheels instead of GPU versions
- **Selective File Copying**: Only necessary application files in final images

[PR #333](https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry/pull/333)

### MongoDB/DocumentDB Storage Backend

Complete migration from file-based storage to production-ready database backends:

- **DocumentDB Support**: AWS DocumentDB for production deployments
- **MongoDB CE Support**: MongoDB Community Edition for local development
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data access layer for flexibility
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic backend selection via configuration
- **Backward Compatibility**: File-based storage deprecated but still supported

[PR #328](https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry/pull/328)

### Test Suite Optimization

Comprehensive pytest test suite with dramatic performance improvements:

- **Performance**: Reduced test execution time from 150s to 30s (80% improvement)
- **Parallel Execution**: 8 parallel workers with pytest-xdist
- **Test Coverage**: 701+ tests (unit, integration, E2E)
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing on all PRs
- **Memory Optimization**: Smart test ordering to prevent OOM on EC2

[PR #330](https://github.com/agentic-community/mcp-gateway-registry/pull/330)

## Breaking Changes

### Storage Backend Migration

**Action Required**: If you're upgrading from v1.0.8 or earlier, you need to migrate from file-based storage to MongoDB/DocumentDB:

1. **Set storage backend** in your `.env`:
   ```bash
   # For production (AWS DocumentDB)
   STORAGE_BACKEND=documentdb
   DOCUMENTDB_URI=mongodb://username:password@cluster.amazonaws.com:27017/?tls=true&retryWrites=false
   
   # For local development (MongoDB CE)
   STORAGE_BACKEND=mongodb
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
   ```

2. **Data migration**: File-based data is not automatically migrated. Re-register servers and agents or use the migration script.

## Upgrade Instructions

### For Docker Compose Deployments

1. **Pull the latest changes:**
```bash
cd mcp-gateway-registry
git pull origin main
git checkout v1.0.9
```

2. **Update environment configuration:**
```bash
# Add storage backend configuration
echo "STORAGE_BACKEND=mongodb" >> .env
echo "MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/" >> .env

# Optional: Remove file-based storage (deprecated)
# STORAGE_TYPE=file  # Remove this line
```

3. **Rebuild and restart:**
```bash
./build_and_run.sh
```

### For AWS ECS Deployment

1. **Update Terraform variables:**
```hcl
# In terraform.tfvars
storage_backend = "documentdb"
```

2. **Apply Terraform changes:**
```bash
cd terraform/aws-ecs
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

3. **Rebuild and push optimized images:**
```bash
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
make build-push
```

### Testing the Upgrade

Verify all components are working:

```bash
# Run E2E tests
./api/test-management-api-e2e.sh --token-file .oauth-tokens/ingress.json --registry-url http://localhost

# Check image sizes
docker images | grep mcp-gateway-registry

# Run pytest suite
make test
```

## Performance Improvements

### Docker Build & Deployment
- **66-80% smaller images**: Faster deployments and reduced storage costs
- **<500MB build context**: Much faster Docker builds
- **Layer reuse**: Better Docker layer caching

### Test Execution

- **Parallel execution**: 8 workers for faster CI/CD
- **Memory efficient**: No more OOM crashes on EC2

### Storage Backend
- **Database-backed storage**: Better scalability and reliability
- **Production-ready**: DocumentDB with Multi-AZ support
- **Local development**: Fast MongoDB CE for testing
