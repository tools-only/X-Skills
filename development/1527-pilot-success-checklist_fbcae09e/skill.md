- [ ] **Quality assessment** - Is generated code production-ready?
- [ ] **Security review** - Any concerns about generated code?

### Week 2 Checkpoint

| Metric                      | Target | Actual  |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Average time savings        | 50%+   | \_\_\_% |
| Code quality (1-5 scale)    | 4+     | \_\_\_  |
| Team confidence (1-5 scale) | 4+     | \_\_\_  |
| Would recommend to others   | Yes    | \_\_\_  |

## Pilot Week 3-4: Real-World Validation

### Production-Adjacent Tasks

- [ ] **Real project work** - Apply Copilot to actual planned work
- [ ] **Complex scenarios** - Multi-resource deployments, edge cases
- [ ] **Team collaboration** - Pair programming with Copilot assistance
- [ ] **Documentation sprint** - Catch up on documentation backlog

### Data Collection

- [ ] **Task log completed** - All tasks with before/after timing
- [ ] **Quality review conducted** - Code review of Copilot-assisted output
- [ ] **Final survey distributed** - Comprehensive feedback questionnaire

## Go/No-Go Decision Framework

### ✅ GO Criteria (all must be true)

- [ ] Time savings ≥ 40% on measured tasks
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities in generated code
- [ ] ≥ 80% of pilot team recommends expansion
- [ ] Quality score ≥ 3.5/5 on code review
- [ ] No unresolved blockers preventing team adoption

### ⚠️ CONDITIONAL GO (requires mitigation)

- [ ] Time savings 25-40% (acceptable with targeted training)
- [ ] Minor security concerns (fixable with review process)
- [ ] 60-80% recommendation rate (investigate holdouts)

### ❌ NO-GO Criteria (any one blocks)

- [ ] Time savings < 25% (not delivering value)
- [ ] Critical security issues (unacceptable risk)
- [ ] < 50% recommendation rate (team resistance)
- [ ] Major unresolved technical blockers

## Post-Pilot Actions

### If GO Decision

- [ ] **Expansion plan created** - Phased rollout to additional team members
- [ ] **Training materials developed** - Based on pilot learnings
- [ ] **Best practices documented** - Effective prompts, workflows
- [ ] **Success story drafted** - For internal communication
- [ ] **Budget approved** - Licenses for expanded team

### If NO-GO Decision

- [ ] **Root cause analysis completed** - Why did the pilot fail?
- [ ] **Remediation plan created** - What would need to change?
- [ ] **Re-pilot timeline set** - When to try again with improvements
- [ ] **Alternative solutions evaluated** - Other tools to consider
