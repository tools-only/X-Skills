# X-Skills Patches

This directory contains **6 skill patches** - curated bundles organized by typical agent use cases.

## What are Patches?

A **patch** is a pre-configured bundle of skills designed for specific types of AI agents. Instead of browsing individual skills, you can install a complete skill set for your use case.
